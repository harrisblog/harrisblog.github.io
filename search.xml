        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>来英国已经半年了，确实如我哥说的那样，你英语最好的时候就是学雅思的时候，言下之意就是不学英语、不用嘴说英语，你雅思学到的口语技巧会慢慢忘记，所以雅思过了不代表你的英语就达标了，还得继续积累。记得有次房屋中介小哥问我有没有 tape measure，我听了两次才听懂是什么东西，真就是我这双耳朵从未听过这个词，但还好当时猜出来了大致意思，还有一次，印度室友跟我聊到了 pressure cooker，我一开始是蒙的，但能够通过 pressure 和 cooker 猜出大致意思——有压力的做饭工具（高压锅），我直接:&quot;Oh! it&#39;s called presure cooker&quot;。实话说，通过和别人对话学英语真的是如我所料地效果低下，半年来也就从对话中学到了这两个例子里的词，其实没有哪个老外有闲工夫陪你练英语、陪你成长，只能说和他们对话是一个检验你英语学习成果的途径，并不是你获得英语知识的主要来源，他们不可能手把手教你念：“Oh! This is apple. That one is banana”，真当他们是再生父母呀？所以这就是为什么我会主动去收集相关英语知识到我的博客里，希望能帮到自己和路过的盆友。</p><p><del>好的我又来水文章了</del>，那么本篇将记录一些我认为生活中用的比较多的常见物品英文表达吧。</p></blockquote><h1 id="家具"><a href="#家具" class="headerlink"

      <title>B站UP主Scott的英文演讲记录</title>
      <link href="/posts/8531ffd/"/>
      <url>/posts/8531ffd/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>我为了提高英语能力，用了很多奇奇怪怪的方式，虽然效果提升不太明显，但我乐意哈哈，我不太喜欢循规蹈矩地去学，因为我一旦脱离预设的轨道，我就会一发不可收拾地摆烂。这篇文章“项目”是我心血来潮创建的，主要是记录B站一名叫 <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/508695150">英文演讲爱好者Scott</a> Up主的一些我认为不错的英文演讲视频 Script，待我某天脑子一热的时候，来读读，念叨念叨也挺好。</p><p>Scripts 按发布日期降序排列。对了，这些 Scripts 我有自己修改过，也用 AI 浅浅润色了下，所以整体和原视频的表达方式有些许出入。</p></blockquote><h1 id="What-are-the-three-top-qualities-that-you-look-for-in-a-friend"><a href="#What-are-the-three-top-qualities-that-you-look-for-in-a-friend" class="headerlink" title="What are the three top qualities that you look for in a friend?"></a><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Yb41197o3">What are the three top qualities that you look for in a friend?</a></h1><p>2023-02-23</p><p>To me, there are definitely three qualities that are essential when it comes to making friends. The first one is Gratitude（感恩、感激）, the second one is Responsibility, and the third one is being positive. As the saying goes: &quot;People either inspire you or drain you（耗尽你）, so choose your friends wisely&quot;. You could agree with me about these qualities and think that it&#39;s really important. And another point that I&#39;m gonna share with you is how we identify if our friends possess these three qualities.</p><p>Firstly, being grateful is an important trait（特质） to look for in a friend. You can just observe how they treat their parents. As we all know, parents are the ones we should respect and be grateful for their great efforts, like <u>feeding us for years</u>. So this is one point we can consider. If they don&#39;t treat their parents very well, how would you expect that they would treat you very well? It doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p><p>Secondly, responsibility is another vital quality to consider. You can see how much time your friends spend with their family members, which is really important. If they are responsible, you can trust them, and you can have some corporation to build or run a company or whatever.</p><p>Lastly, being positive is an essential trait for a friend to have. You can observe how your friends talk and what they say. Do they complain all the time? Do they say something really positive, praise someone and appreciate the help they received from others? If they have a positive outlook on life, they are more likely to inspire and uplift you（激励振奋你）.</p><p>With these three qualities,  you are more likely to have inspiring friends rather than draining ones（耗费精力的朋友）. So my friend, please remember that people either inspire you or drain you, choose them wisely.</p><p>And another one is really important. If you really wanna make friends with these three qualities, you&#39;re gotta be the one with these three qualities at first. Because human beings are attracted to people who share similar qualities. So strive to be the one you wanna make friends with. Eventually, you&#39;re gonna make friends like this.</p><h1 id="Should-all-education-at-all-levels-be-free"><a href="#Should-all-education-at-all-levels-be-free" class="headerlink" title="Should all education at all levels be free?"></a><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1je4y1c7nE/">Should all education at all levels be free?</a></h1><p>2023-02-18</p><p>This is a really interesting question, so what do you think about that? Well, getting something for free is usually a nice thing for most people. But there is one saying I like the most, which is: &quot;In this world, the most luxurious thing is something that free of charge&quot;. So you can imagine that you can get whatever you want, whatever kinda training resources you want for free. But later on, you may start to realize that it&#39;s just free of charge. I don&#39;t have to take time to learn and I just wanna get it. And maybe most people tend to take that for granted and they won&#39;t take the time to learn that deeply.</p><p>On the other hand, you can see that we have excellent courses that are designed by experts who put a lotta time and effort into creating them. If these courses are just given away for free and the designers don&#39;t get paid, they may lose the motivation to continue creating such excellent courses anymore. So you see that the free of charge leads to a very negative result. That&#39;s why some countries like the United States or some European countries have this kinda copyright law. For example, music and even though some pictures or videos have the copyright. That means if you wanna use that you need to pay for the author because you need to respect their creativity and also the creator needs to get paid for that. This creates a positive cycle and the designer, author or creator would like to do more for that and create excellent courses or masterpieces later on.</p><p>That&#39;s why education works the same way. If we get everything for free, just think about those teachers and course designers, they may lose their passion, and we won&#39;t have excellent courses anymore. So my friend, free of charge is okay, but remember that in this world the most luxurious stuff is free of charge.</p><h1 id="What-do-you-think-about-alcohol-culture-in-China"><a href="#What-do-you-think-about-alcohol-culture-in-China" class="headerlink" title="What do you think about alcohol culture in China?"></a><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JM411q7Yo/">What do you think about alcohol culture in China?</a></h1><p>2023-01-25</p><p>It&#39;s gonna be a really interesting question, especially in China. There are different alcohol cultures in China. I was born in the middle of China and I felt like in my hometown we got a very strong alcohol culture. In my hometown, it&#39;s very common for people to say &quot;bro, let&#39;s bottom it up&quot;, because they believe the more you drink with them, the closer relationship you&#39;ve got. So this is kinda an interesting point. But when I started working in a company, I didn&#39;t drink quite a lot with my colleagues when we have a gathering or parties. So this kinda different culture is really interesting.</p><p>I believe there&#39;s no right or wrong when it comes to alcohol culture. I&#39;m not gonna judge the culture. But the most important thing in my mind is who you&#39;re gonna drink with. Is this the right time? I still remember when I was in college, I once participated in a party, but I was like I don&#39;t know them, I don&#39;t wanna drink with them. You know how some people act when they&#39;re drunk. I personally don&#39;t enjoy that, and sometimes I feel pressured to drink. So I only drank one cup of beer and then I threw it all away. That kinda feeling was really terrible. But I still remember that a couple of weeks ago, I visited my dad, I also bought the rice wine, because I felt like this is the right time. And then I drank a bit with my dad because we seldom have a very deep conversation. You know sometimes, alcohol can help us open up（敞开心扉）and have deeper conversations. After we drank alcohol, we got a very good time as my dad shared what was going on in his life, and I also shared something interesting about work and life.</p><p>So, my friend, there&#39;s nothing wrong or right with alcohol. But the most important thing for us is that we really need to pick up the right person that we&#39;re gonna drink with. And we need to think about whether is it the right time to drink alcohol.</p><h1 id="What-gets-you-excited-about-life"><a href="#What-gets-you-excited-about-life" class="headerlink" title="What gets you excited about life?"></a><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pg411n7c8">What gets you excited about life?</a></h1><p>2022-12-12</p><p>I know it&#39;s gonna be a really hard question to answer. Honestly speaking, I used to be a person who didn&#39;t have this kinda excitement about life, especially when I was working in the company for several years. I was like this is life. It&#39;s just from home to the company and doing something that I don&#39;t really like, but I still need to earn money. And after work, I just wanna enjoy something I really like, for example, watching some TV dramas, searching on the internet and playing computer games. But I gradually found that boring life I cannot change. I lost the passion I used to have. Because when I was in college, I was really into programming skills. As you can see, sometimes when you conquer some challenges or difficulties, that kinda sense of achievement will make you really excited. But I didn&#39;t have this kinda feeling for a long time. I know it&#39;s gonna be a terrible thing if I lose the passion. That&#39;s the reality.</p><p>But after that, I found there was one person in my life, who is also a toastmaster member（英语演讲会成员）. By the first time, I saw him, he was really energetic on the stage. His body language and vocal variety（声调抑扬顿挫）were really amazing. I thought this is the person I really like. Because I saw the passion, the excitement in his life. I still remember the topic of the speech he was delivering is about travelling. He said: &quot;no matter physical or mental, we need to travel and then our body or our spirit can on the way&quot;, which really inspired me. That kinda passion and excitement really influenced my lifestyle. After that, I tried to have a conversation with him, and he said something that really shocked me. You know, he was already at a very top level, he&#39;s a really excellent professional trainer, he got a very satisfying salary and he got a reputation in society, but he&#39;s still hard working on the stage and tried to do something with excitement. He practices yoga, tai chi and plays the guitar and also he&#39;s a very great Kongfu master. I thought I need to be someone full of passion and full excitement like him. He once told me: &quot;There are three circles in our lives, one is something we are good at, the second one is something we need to do, and the third circle is something we can do and will bring value to others, and then we need to make these three circles overlapped. The more they overlapped, the more excitement you will feel in your life&quot;. So at that moment, I&#39;m trying to find the three circles in my life. That&#39;s why I try to practice my speech, especially English public speaking. Because in my company, I also need to use English to communicate with others. This is something I really like, but I cannot say this is something that I&#39;m good at, because I&#39;m still learning. The better my communication skill, the more working opportunities in my career, which can also bring benefits to others, especially sometimes when I have a good idea, if I can convey my message to others with a very constructive structure（建设性的结构）, somebody will definitely get some benefits from my sharing. So this is the fact that I get to find the excitement in my life.</p><p>And later on, I try to join the toastmaster club to practice my public speaking skill. I gradually found that every day is a good day. Because I really cannot wait the next day, there&#39;s gonna be something new in my life. Learning something new can give me this kinda excitement and passion again. So finding excitement and passion in your life is the top priority thing. If you don&#39;t have it, just keep looking until you find your true excitement in your life. And you&#39;ll find your life will be colourful and you&#39;ll never neglect every minute every second of your life.</p><h1 id="What-do-you-think-about-a-happy-childhood-or-high-scores"><a href="#What-do-you-think-about-a-happy-childhood-or-high-scores" class="headerlink" title="What do you think about a happy childhood or high scores?"></a><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1XD4y1b7Bw/">What do you think about a happy childhood or high scores?</a></h1><p>2022-10-28 </p><p>I like this question so much. I wanna answer this question based on my perspective. Honestly speaking, when I was a child I didn&#39;t have a happy childhood. Not only was I not a good student in school, but my parents also got divorced, so I didn&#39;t have the chance to see them very often. I had a babysitter（保姆）, so every day, all I needed to do was come back from school, grab something to eat and finish my homework. The only thing that made me happy was playing video games. However, I didn&#39;t consider that I had a very happy childhood at that moment. On the other hand, I hated studying. Believe it or not, I think it was because I was not a good student and I was trying to study hard, but it didn&#39;t work. It seemed like studying was not my thing, so I preferred to chase happiness. When I play video games, I felt like I could focus on something, which gave me a sense of fulfilment（满足感，成就感）. So that was the moment that made me happy, but not a period with long-term happiness.</p><p>Comparing this with my life as an adult got me thinking about what is the key factor to make my life happier. But the answer is happiness doesn&#39;t come from having or doing something you really like. In the adult world, sometimes we cannot choose what we really want. We need to accept what we have, right? Therefore, I think the most important thing for us to have a happier life is that we need to appreciate what we have because how we feel about what we are doing or what we have is more important. If I had a chance to go back to my childhood, I would have studied harder, even though I was not a good student. The most significant thing for me to cherish at that moment was that I had energy which allowed me to remember and learn something quickly. Because when we grow up, our memory will go down, so we cannot remember something very clearly. And I also wanna do something like exercise when I was a child because I know exercising can really bring lotta benefits to me. Compared to studying, I know studying hard is important in the current world, but it isn&#39;t the key thing to determine whether a kid is good or not. So I think that having a good attitude, being positive, and being optimistic are the really key factors for kids to become happy. I understand it&#39;s really challenging in our competitive society. And most parents want their kids can be capable of handling many things and have multiple skills. However, do you think that will make your kid&#39;s life happier? I don&#39;t think so.</p><p>Well, back to our topic, happy childhood or high scores in childhood, I think that doesn&#39;t matter. The most important thing to do is to have a good attitude, a positive attitude, being kind and grateful. That is the key thing to making your life happier. No matter if you are a kid or if you are already an adult. So, my friend, I wish you a very happy life, keep going, keep positive and then you will be grateful for what you have.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Redux in React 学习笔记</title>
      <link href="/posts/c631f0b6/"/>
      <url>/posts/c631f0b6/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><a href="https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started">官方文档</a>，<a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/react/redux-intro-cgM9Byu7">视频教程</a></p></blockquote><h1 id="What-is-Redux"><a href="#What-is-Redux" class="headerlink" title="What is Redux?"></a>What is Redux?</h1><h2 id="Intro"><a href="#Intro" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h2><p>Redux 是一种 JS 状态管理库，可用于任何 JS 应用程序，包括 React。Redux 提供单一的状态存储，可在整个应用程序中共享，方便跨组件共享数据。</p><p>在Redux中，状态存储在一个称为<code>Store</code>的对象中，并且只能通过<code>Action</code>来修改。<code>Reducer</code>函数用于处理<code>Action</code>，并返回新的状态对象。</p><p>它类似于 Context 概念，但 Context 并不像 Redux 那样提供状态管理和更新机制，你需要自己实现逻辑来修改 Context 中的数据。Redux 和 Context 是两种不同的技术，用于解决不同的问题，在一些小型应用或者组件层次较浅的应用中，使用 Context 可能会更加简单和方便。但在复杂应用中，Redux 的状态管理机制能够让你更方便地组织和管理应用的状态，也更容易调试和维护。</p><h2 id="Workflow"><a href="#Workflow" class="headerlink" title="Workflow"></a>Workflow</h2><p>Redux中的数据流是单向的，从<code>View</code>（视图）到<code>Action</code>（动作）再到<code>Reducer</code>（处理器）再到<code>Store</code>（存储器），最终再次返回到<code>View</code>中。当一个<code>Action</code>被触发后，它会被传递到<code>Reducer</code>中进行处理，<code>Reducer</code>返回一个新的状态对象，<code>Store</code>保存这个新的状态对象，然后通知<code>View</code>进行更新。</p><h1 id="Core-concepts"><a href="#Core-concepts" class="headerlink" title="Core concepts"></a>Core concepts</h1><p>为了形象理解概念，这将用餐厅举例：</p><p>Action 👉 Your Order</p><p>Dispatch 👉 Restaurant Server</p><p>Reducer 👉 Chef</p><p>Store 👉 Whole Restaurant</p><p>State 👉 它可以是餐厅内部的各种状态的集合，比如餐桌占用情况、食材库存等</p><p>getState 👉 获取餐厅当前的状态</p><p>Subscribe 👉 餐厅经理时刻关注/监视餐厅状态的变化，比如营业额、食材库存等</p><blockquote><p>厨师（Reducer）处理服务员（Dispatch）传来的订单（Action）</p></blockquote><h2 id="Action"><a href="#Action" class="headerlink" title="Action"></a>Action</h2><p>Action 是个普通 JS 对象，用于<u>描述发生的事件</u>和<u>携带数据</u>。也是应用状态的唯一来源，因为它们描述了应用中发生的所有事件，包括用户操作、网络响应等等。Action 常被用来触发状态的更新。</p><figure class="highlight jsx"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span

I love building apps that solve real-world problems, and that are delightful to use. My specialities include TypeScript, React JS, Tailwind CSS, and Styled Components.</p><p>My background is in teaching and marketing, and I have a bachelors degree in English from Kings College. I also have five adorable cats.</p></li><li><p>A Front-End Developer based in London, UK</p></li><li><p>Hey! My name is Denise. I am a web &amp; font designer based in Utah</p><p>I have been working as a freelance designer and front-end developer since 2007. I’ve always been someone who has both a creative and a logical side. When I discovered web design in college, I realized it would be the perfect fit. I could use my creative side to design and my logical side to code. As a bonus, being both designer and developer allows me to make sure no detail is lost in translation.</p></li><li><p>Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer over 11 years ago, I&#39;ve done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business and consumer use. I&#39;m quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops one design problem at a time.</p></li><li><p>Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML &amp; CSS!</p></li></ul><h2 id="Projects"><a href="#Projects" class="headerlink" title="Projects"></a>Projects</h2><ul><li><p>All my projects include links to the code and live version.

Over the years, I&#39;ve used hundreds of web and mobile apps in different industries and verticals. Eventually, I decided that it would be a fun challenge to try designing and building my own.</p></li><li><p>I love working with small businesses</p><p>I specialize in creating sites for individuals and small businesses. You shouldn’t have to settle for cheap solutions or generic templates. I provide custom designs at afforable prices. Frequently your website is the first impression your customers will get, so make sure it’s a good one. Since my time is split between a few different things, I’m not able to take on every project I’d like to, but I&#39;m always looking for fun work.

      <title>邵艾伦Alan美式口语网课笔记</title>
      <link href="/posts/7f6d81d5/"/>
      <url>/posts/7f6d81d5/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>我关注邵艾伦Alan几年了，好像从19年二十万粉左右开始关注的，那个时候他会做一些和外国人聊天的视频，各种油管视频的reaction，我看得开心的同时也能学到英语。如今他的频道越做越大，已经两百万粉丝了，近期也在B站发布了自己教的美式口语视频课程，我觉得很不错。虽然他没有那些英语老师教的专业，但是我依旧会选择看他的课程，除了粉丝滤镜之外，他的教学模式可谓是全网比较独特的吧。在学习新的语言这一方面，我个人偏向于“婴儿式”学习方法，就是不断输入，同时也要尝试着输出，不需要刻意去学习语法、音标，总而言之就是你知道如何说就行，不需要太多了解其中的原理。当然我已经学了15年的英语，我的基础已经比较扎实了，所以我更需要接触那些常用日常的口语表达，其实很多书、很多教学视频里面教的内容相当一部分还是不够地道，或者有些过时，至少对于我而言，而Alan的课是直接从他和别人对话视频中截取的教学素材，内容非常 fresh，表达也很地道，同时Alan会说一些很街头很嘻哈开玩笑的话，这些也是我的兴趣之一。以上是我的个人想法，不具有普适性，他的课还是挺适合我的。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>全套课程看完了，学到了很多，还需慢慢沉淀。</p><p>第一轮复习：2-12</p><p>课程直达：<a href="https://www.bilibili.com/cheese/play/ss1060">邵艾伦英语二合一【口语突飞猛进】【美式口音速成】</a></p></blockquote><h1 id="单词"><a href="#单词" class="headerlink" title="单词"></a>单词</h1><ol><li><p>Vibe.

      <title>博客二周年纪念</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>时间都去哪了？明明才写完《一周年纪念》怎么第二年这么快到了。。。本篇文章就用意识流来写（<del>实在没空去精修文字表达</del>）</p></blockquote><h1 id="回顾去年"><a href="#回顾去年" class="headerlink" title="回顾去年"></a>回顾去年</h1><p>第二年呢，其实在博客上花的时间比去年较少，以前的我可能和博客的样式杠上了，成天没日没夜地美化魔改，可能现在新鲜感过了吧，目前我看到哪个地方有些小不和谐，我心想：凑合着用用算了，目前我的心态发生了一些变化，也挺好，博客确实文章更重要。对于我来说，博客更新速度和我的学习成果有一定联系，我发现如果学习不做笔记的话，我一定会把知识忘得一干二净，像 HTML、CSS、JavaScript，我明明2020年左右的时候在网上自学过，但是用起来发现，大多数都忘记了，所以我不得不额外花时间去重新记笔记，何况我现在在留学，这里的时间可谓是一寸光阴十寸金，在这待一天，你会发现，我晕，一千人民币又干没了。无论如何，大家学习的时候一定要记得做笔记。作为学计算机的，我发现我的 iPad Pro 2020 貌似用不出它大部分的价值，以前想着做做笔记，打打草稿，现在发现博客基本就够了，iPad 最多是打草稿和看上课 PPT 的，于是真就<del>买前生产力，买后爱奇艺</del>，我有时索性直接用 iPhone 看视频，因为iPad有些重不方便拿哈哈。话说回来，今年情况不尽人意，博客文章产出不多，我的原计划是每个月至少 5 篇文章，当然我对自己也是有一些隐性标准，比如：</p><ol><li>每篇尽量至少 1k 字。</li><li>学习一门科目，或者一门开发框架的时候，尽量不要将每一章节作为一篇文章，或者一个小问题大谈特谈。</li></ol><p>大概如此，其实没有好坏之分，每个人想法不同，我目前是这么潜在要求自己，其实水文章也很好水，随便转载一篇好文章很省事，但我太懒了也不想经常这么做，我还是想多写点对我自己也对路过的朋友有帮助的文章，比如各种前端知识、找工作方面的事情等等。</p><p>截止目前网站的<strong>数据统计</strong>（与去年对比）：</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>去年（2021.11.13）</th><th>今年（2022.11.13）</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>文章数目</td><td>55</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td>本站总字数</td><td>113.4k</td><td>224.6k</td></tr><tr><td>本站访客数</td><td>3906</td><td>14511</td></tr><tr><td>本站总访问量</td><td>14667</td><td>47042</td></tr></tbody></table><p>看了数据后，我还是挺惊讶的，有点无心插柳柳成荫，但文章数目我不太满意，我这一年确实比较懒，然后依旧效率低下，知识类文章产出比较少。</p><p>还记得曾经自己想过，博客我先写它个十年再说，但是随着时间的推移，有时候有一丝放弃的想法，但是一想到我现在如果不写博客的话，我学过的东西一定会容易忘记，于是我不得不坚持写博客，我好像依赖上它了。此外，一想到曾经在大学课也不上就在那里两眼放空地思考如何让博客更加好看，设计更得体，就不忍心放弃自己缝缝补补东拼西凑了两年的博客，就像自己的孩子一样，已经两岁啦，舍不得丢。</p><h1 id="展望未来"><a href="#展望未来" class="headerlink" title="展望未来"></a>展望未来</h1><p>未来我应该是不会再继续更 Butterfly 主题相关的魔改美化了，可能已经过了那个热情，就算写也不会太保姆，比如要改哪个文件，因为前端技术、主题版本更新迭代太快了，教程很容易过期，更多的我希望给路过的盆友一些灵感，就比如要实现一个时钟的组件，我可能会给出实现思路，或者进一步给出HTML、CSS、JS 代码，但是要适配你的网站就要靠你自己修改部分代码了，毕竟经历一次确实能锻炼到自己，也越能把网站定制成你想要的样子。</p><p>未来我依然对自己有着与往年相同的要求，尽量每个月写5篇及以上有质量的博文，不断学习，无限进步。多学技术，多做点项目，希望明年能找到一个不错的前端工作。</p>]]></content>

      <title>打印机使用日记——吐槽蛋疼的加墨方式</title>
      <link href="/posts/d5b87a06/"/>
      <url>/posts/d5b87a06/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>这款是<strong>佳能腾彩 MG2580S</strong>打印机，从我哥家那借来的，他已几年没有使用，也忘了当初的一些使用过程，并且人在外地，所以我就不麻烦他了，打算自己查阅并摸索使用方法。</p><p>现在心情十分糟糕，因为我已经花了半天的时间在打印机上了，现在满手都是三四种颜色的墨水，其实它明明是一件看得着很简单的事情，这款打印机又不是打印店用的那种按钮特别多，需要一一弄清楚，但就是各种相关事情加起来能把我搞疯！</p><p>首先第一个挫折是，需要安装驱动，于是我在佳能官网找到了这款驱动，但是在安装过程中，显示 MP driver 还没有下载，于是乎我在百度找了半天，但都没有找到解决方案，最后阴差阳错在<a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1sF411E7QC">B 站的一个视频</a>里找到了解决方案，我可能在官网找错了驱动。第二个挫折就是，它的三个指示灯在亮，有时候三个全亮，有时候其中两个灯在亮，在网上查了后得知，分别有不同的意思以及不同的故障原因，例如：没有墨水了，墨盒接触不良，墨盒坏了等等，就接触不良这个原因，我来来回回安装/拆卸了十几次，然后墨水也加了很多次，第一次使用，没有经验，而且我只是打印几张纸而已，也别问为什么不在外面打印，我家附近没有专门的打印店，而且我一个工科生，总是要了解如何使用打印机的，有这个借的机会为何不把握呢？就这个加墨水的过程我得好好吐槽吐槽，我借来的东西还包括一个收纳盒，里边有四瓶墨水，颜色分别是黑红蓝黄，还有三支针管，为啥不直接把墨水往墨盒里倒啊？还要搞这么麻烦，需要用针把墨吸出来然后再挤到墨盒里。一开始没有经验，我把针管活塞拔了，然后往里倒墨水，我想着针头的孔小，应该有大气压的缘故可以使它不漏出来，结果倒进去的墨水直接从针头处全漏了，给我一种鼻血的感觉，没有任何水的张力，直接往下疯狂地掉，漏到我手上加桌子上，印子在手上还洗不掉，气 s 我了。最后思考一番，应该是要直接从墨水瓶里吸到注射器里，再注射到墨盒里，但这无法一人完成，于是我让我爸倾斜拿着墨水瓶，我用注射器吸，主要那个墨水瓶口小、瓶身高且墨水不多了，需要把瓶子倾斜着，我再左手捏着注射器，右手拉活塞将墨水吸进来，最后注射到墨水盒里，且不说我拔了活塞这件事导致我手上染了很多墨水，就算我正常操作，也会不由自主碰到墨水，例如，针管注射完了后，墨盒的进墨口周围多少会粘点墨，然后扭瓶盖的时候，也会有部分墨水溢出来，总而言之，给墨盒加墨水的整个操作非常不优雅不丝滑，浪费了我很多时间，而且还染了我一手五颜六色，在此敢问发明者，有没有更合适的加墨方案？？？</p><p>说到这，你以为完了？成功了？没有，打印机好不容易被调整到可以顺利执行打印操作的状态（因为墨水盒有问题的话，它是不会工作的），打印出来的纸张只有一丢丢墨水，无法观看，我已经加了很多次墨水了，还是没有用，我就差整瓶往里灌了，要知道往里加一次墨水很麻烦的，上一段已经吐槽过。最后，以失败告终，虽然很难受，但我至少比未使用过打印机的人多一些经验。这次失败，我推测是硬件问题，大概率是需要更换一个墨盒，<strong>我未来要买打印机的话，会额外看加墨方式是否优雅</strong>，我不希望在加墨过程中费时费力。</p><p>我真的是在某些方面勇于探索并且愿意拼搏到成功的那一刻，但天有不测风云，还得接受失败，也正好及时止损。</p><blockquote><p>对了，记录一个小技巧：<strong>长按“停止键”8 秒，可以刷新墨盒接触状态</strong>。</p><p>比如墨盒接触不良，你重新安装上去后，要执行以上操作，橙色指示灯状态才会刷新。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

href="#Using-an-async-function-inside-useEffect-Clone" class="headerlink" title="Using an async function inside useEffect(Clone)"></a>Using an async function inside useEffect(Clone)</h3><p>useEffect takes a function as its parameter. If that function returns something, it needs to be a cleanup function. Otherwise, it should return nothing. If we make it an async function, it automatically retuns a promise instead of a function or nothing. Therefore, if you want to use async operations inside of useEffect, you need to define the function separately inside of the callback function, as seen below:</p><figure class="highlight

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>本篇相当于本科四年的回忆录，意识流畅所欲言</p></blockquote><h1 id="拍摄剪辑部"><a href="#拍摄剪辑部" class="headerlink" title="拍摄剪辑部"></a>拍摄剪辑部</h1><p>高中那会，可能是短视频和综艺的盛行，使我对视频后期非常感兴趣。高中毕业后我初步在网上查了查，好像没有剪辑这么一个专业，于是就选择了我一直很看好的计算机专业。为了满足我的剪辑爱好，我毅然决然在大一学生会招人那会选择了剪辑部，不得不说，和其它部门比起来，真的非常累，我们干事经常肝视频到凌晨，如果遇到电脑死机，而且剪辑没有保存的话那就完蛋功亏一篑了。对于那些剪辑技术，其实大部分时间是靠我们自学，不得不说，在B站自学剪辑技巧真的很快乐，很有成就感，遗憾的是，那时候没有接触博客，很多经验技巧都没有想着说记录下来，所以现在让我剪视频效果和以前差远了，但读研期间，我有拍Vlog记录生活的打算，还是有机会接触剪辑的😊。</p><p>大一除了学到很多剪辑技巧外，我还接触到了云台，部门宣传片里很丝滑的运镜都是我设计并拍出来的哈哈，话说我们当时的剪辑部部长都没怎么用过云台，招我进来是你们正确的选择哈哈哈，还记得我那时候对云台非常热爱，甚至寒假斥巨资买了手机云台。</p><p>大二时，我选择担任部长，恰逢拍摄部和剪辑部合并，话说，我觉得合并是个正确的选择，因为制作一个视频，需要拍摄部和剪辑部密切地合作探讨，否则拍出来的素材后期可能不想要，像一些重大活动，比如运动会、领导发言，事后是无法补救的，所以一定要提前商量好大概拍哪些素材以及是远景还是近景还是特写，其实对于一个学院的小部门来说，尽量做到物尽其用很重要，因为拍摄器材就那么多，无法像拍电视节目一样，有很多个机位，素材非常充足，当然素材非常多的话，对剪辑人员来说是非常头痛的，回忆起来，好像每次制作一个视频的拍摄素材差不多30多G，处理起来真的很头痛，你得快速看完每一个素材并命名，我们剪辑都是用自己的笔记本电脑，普通的笔记本剪辑来非常卡顿，学院太穷了没办法，连拍摄器材还是借的，其中一个器材还是一个部长自己买的。</p><p>记得大二部门招新还是一件比较头疼的事情，来应聘的人不是很多，报名的人有20多人，实际来的10多个，我们原打算招12人，最后招了11个，令我们满意的人选好像只有两三个。记得我大一第一次部门开会时，我们老部长说这一届招新不如上一届，哈哈，真就是一届不如一届，但是我敢保证我们这一届剪的部门宣传片直接吊打所有届，我大一和大二期间的灵感爆棚，各种好点子横空出世，我还有两个队友也是剪辑技术挺不错的，直接为部门宣传片添砖加瓦。</p><h1 id="舞蹈队"><a href="#舞蹈队" class="headerlink" title="舞蹈队"></a>舞蹈队</h1><p>记得我小学时，就经常趴在街舞室的窗外看那些哥哥姐姐们跳舞，感觉好帅，我妈看我喜欢就把我带进去准备报班，但我比较害羞腼腆，不敢在人群面前展现自己，最后我坚决不去，其实内心还是比较想的。我从小就很反感各种补习班，害怕见到新同学，尤其是父母让我去的话，我会持逆反心理。</p><p>到了大学，我真香地报名了校舞蹈队，当时还在纠结去舞蹈队还是合唱队，但我没学过跳舞（我可没说我学过唱歌，<del>有嘴就行</del>），想去学学，听说零基础也可以进，于是我就信心大增，不出我所料，顺利通过了部门面试，面试过程就是自我介绍，然后几个队长分别教我舞蹈动作，看看我学的快不快，我可是幼儿园就被老师夸过学跳操的速度很快，动作做得很不错。</p><p>但是！哈哈，我接下来想吐槽一下。提前说声，校舞蹈队主要负责为学校里各大舞台提供艺术节目，如果没有节目任务的话，我们就一周四天中午聚集在舞蹈室练一个多小时的基本功，其中两天练古典或现代舞，两天练街舞，下午第一二节课我直接昏昏欲睡，而且中午只有半小时时间给你下课飞奔到食堂、吃饭、从食堂飞奔到舞蹈室，如果有节目的话，那就要挤出更多的时间来排练舞蹈节目，甚至会让你推掉一些其它不重要的活动来进行舞蹈排练，一般一个舞蹈节目要排很久，动作好不容易学会了，还要排队形，扣动作细节和质感，我们经常在舞蹈室排上大半天的时间，晚上十点多回去甚至没有热水洗澡，我有时还挺羡慕那些排练歌唱、小品节目的队，我们排好一个节目要二十来天，也羡慕室友能无忧无虑待在宿舍打游戏追剧。</p><p>话说，我阴差阳错地进入了两个最累的社团——拍摄剪辑部、舞蹈队😭😭😭，但收获是真的有，技多不压身嘛，累是真的累，快乐是真的快乐！</p><h1 id="毕业设计"><a href="#毕业设计" class="headerlink" title="毕业设计"></a>毕业设计</h1><p>貌似很多同学已经早早地选好了毕设导师，我算是中期选好了导师，不算早也不算晚。我选择了学院的一个教授，我想着教授应该很专业，结果教授非常忙，在毕业设计上没有给到我太多的帮助，对比我其它同学，看着他们和导师的百条聊天记录真的很羡慕，我和导师只有十多条聊天记录。</p><p>我的毕设还是非常传统的项目——网站，哈哈哈，后端是真的两年来都没学会，但是为了毕设我咬咬牙还是学会了，网站顺利做出来了，我自己对这个网站还是很满意的，这网站的UI设计还得益于我玩了2年的博客，我的审美还是阔以滴哈哈哈，预答辩老师可能为了保持严肃形象，于是只好浅浅地夸了夸：“网站做的还是挺流畅的，交互什么的还可以”，md直接说：“网站做的碉堡了”不就行了嘛😏，而且夸完了，还找我茬，挑我论文的毛病，关键预答辩的时候，我已经吊打大多数人了，对我还这么严格。</p><p>整个毕业设计过程中，令我很不悦的是，导师最后一个月突然作妖，他在群里说请同学们及时提交论文最新版，我去交的时候发现他已经打了分，提交入口关了，我就一整个迷惑了，他此前明明没有在群里说要将论文最新版提交到网站，我问其他同学，他们都已经提交了论文，我真是大无语了，无论其他同学交没交，这应该是导师的失职，导师明明没有说，还自行改分，果不其然最后分数比较低，因为他改的是我的初稿，写的肯定没有最新版的好，跟导师说了也没用，大怨种。</p><p>最终答辩的那一天老师才临时通知有英语回答的部分，很多同学在空间吐槽，但我直接狂喜，我雅思可不是白考的，英语回答还算顺利，然后整体答辩自认为还不错，可惜答辩成绩只有82，真的不理解，但是我只能安慰自己，分数不重要，反正我有研究生可读。</p><h1 id="爱情"><a href="#爱情" class="headerlink" title="爱情"></a>爱情</h1><p>没想到我有幸在学生时代的尾巴找到了属于自己的爱情。</p><p>其实从小到大我都没有刻意去追求爱情，都是随缘心态，如果缘分到了就冲吧这么一个想法，要是问学生时代有没有心动的女生，那肯定是有，但也只是停留在眼球的愉悦，不足以让我去主动追求。要是问有没有追过我的女生，有很多，但我总觉得没有达到我想谈的那个阈值，人话说就是不够喜欢。我比较长情，不轻易进入恋爱关系，这也使我Solo了21年，我从不觉得20多年还没有谈过是件非常奇怪的事情，History再怎么丰富，很多人不依然留不住那个Ta吗？有一种单身叫单身贵族。</p><p>这段异地的感情现在谈了大半年，整体上还行，遇到那个她算是千载难逢的缘分，请耐心听我娓娓道来。我们最初是在微博某网友帖子下的评论区认识的，通过这种方式相遇的概率极低，能够抓住并发展成爱情的概率就更低了，通常一些情侣可能是同学或者同事，可能今天没有缘分深入交流，那好，还有明天、后天、下周。。。也许某一天就碰撞出了爱的火花，但我们就那一瞬，抓不住，就错过了。话说回来，通过微博相遇这种方式，就已经初步确定了我俩的兴趣爱好类似、未来发展一致、英文名很配、生日同一天且小我一岁，通过这几点已经很有缘分了，随后互加了好友，经过几天的聊天，我们发现彼此很多东西都非常匹配，心有灵犀，她直接满足我99%的择偶标准了，我一直以来都觉得自己择偶标准很严苛，实在没想到真有人能一次性满足那么多标准，这难道就是我的真命天女吗？但是！我不知为何，总感觉到100%那个点我才会主动追求，很多人估计早就先入为主了hh，就这样我们以朋友的关系持续了3个月，这3个月中有争吵、有暧昧、有冷战、有磨合，话说这不应该是情侣应该做的事情吗？但难能可贵的是，争吵之后还能“紧紧相拥”，无论如何，兜兜转转后我俩在一起了。在这我想说，请珍惜你爱和爱你的人，不留遗憾，缘分到了，不要犹豫去抓住它，我这段缘分是个特例，其实一般感觉到位了就可以主动追求。</p><p>能在学生时代的尾巴找到属于自己的爱情，我已经很满足了。</p><blockquote><p><strong>结束语</strong>：</p><p>四年就这么一瞬间过去了，虽然没有什么惊天动地的事情，但是平凡也值得去回味，这可是我的青春啊，回不去的青春。我始终持有活在当下的想法，走好当下每一步，结果不会太差。毕业后呢，我就继续踏踏实实走好每一步，享受当下的每时每分，期待自己找到一个好工作，步入职场的里程到喽～</p></blockquote>]]></content>

的对象，第一次查询出之后会自动将该对象保存到缓存中，当下一次查询时，直接从缓存中取出对象即可，⽆无需再次访问数据库。</p><ul><li>MyBatis 缓存分类</li></ul><ol><li>一级缓存：SqlSession 级别，默认开启，并且不能关闭。</li></ol><p>操作数据库时需要创建 SqlSession 对象，在对象中有一个 HashMap ⽤于存储缓存数据，不同的 SqlSession 之间缓存数据区域是互不影响的。</p><p>一级缓存的作⽤域是 SqlSession 范围的，当在同一个 SqlSession 中执⾏两次相同的 SQL 语句时，第一次执⾏完毕会将结果保存到缓存中，第二次查询时直接从缓存中获取。</p><p>需要注意的是，如果 SqlSession 执⾏了了 DML 操作（insert、update、delete），MyBatis 必须将缓存<br>清空以保证数据的准确性。</p><ol start="2"><li>二级缓存：Mapper 级别，默认关闭，可以开启。</li></ol><p>使⽤二级缓存时，多个 SqlSession 使⽤同一个 Mapper 的 SQL 语句操作数据库，得到的数据会存在二级缓存区，同样是使⽤ HashMap 进⾏数据存储，相⽐较于一级缓存，二级缓存的范围更⼤，多个 SqlSession 可以共⽤二级缓存，二级缓存是跨 SqlSession 的。</p><p>二级缓存是多个 SqlSession 共享的，其作⽤域是 Mapper 的同一个 namespace，不同的 SqlSession 两次执⾏相同的 namespace 下的 SQL 语句，参数也相等，则第一次执⾏成功之后会将数据保存到二级缓存中，第二次可直接从二级缓存中取出数据。</p><blockquote><p>代码</p></blockquote><ul><li>一级缓存</li></ul><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>参考 B 站<strong>楠哥教你学 Java</strong>的<a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1GE411d7KE">Spring MVC 从入门到实战</a>视频</p></blockquote><p>Spring MVC 是目前主流的实现 MVC 设计模式的企业级开发框架，Spring 框架的一个子模块，无需整合，开发起来更加便捷。</p><h1 id="什么是-MVC-设计模式？"><a href="#什么是-MVC-设计模式？" class="headerlink" title="什么是 MVC 设计模式？"></a>什么是 MVC 设计模式？</h1><p>将应用程序分为 <strong>Controller</strong>、<strong>Model</strong>、<strong>View</strong> 三层。</p><p>Controller 接收客户端请求，调用 Model 生成业务数据，传递给 View。</p><p>Spring MVC 就是对这套流程的封装，屏蔽了很多底层代码，开放出接口，让开发者可以更加轻松、便捷地完成基于 MVC 模式的 Web 开发。</p><h1 id="核心组件"><a href="#核心组件" class="headerlink" title="核心组件"></a>核心组件</h1><ul><li><strong>DispatcherServlet</strong>：前置控制器，是整个流程控制的核心，控制其他组件的执行，进行统一调度，降低组件之间的耦合性，相当于总指挥。</li><li><strong>Handler</strong>：处理器，完成具体的业务逻辑，相当于 Servlet 或 Action。</li><li><strong>HandlerMapping</strong>：DispatcherServlet 接收到请求之后，通过 HandlerMapping 将不同的请求映射到不同的 Handler。</li><li><strong>HandlerInterceptor</strong>：处理器拦截器，是一个接口，如果需要完成一些拦截处理，可以实现该接口。</li><li><strong>HandlerExecutionChain</strong>：处理器执行链，包括两部分内容：Handler 和 HandlerInterceptor（系统会有一个默认的 HandlerInterceptor，如果需要额外设置拦截，可以添加拦截器）。</li><li><strong>HandlerAdapter</strong>：处理器适配器，Handler 执行业务方法之前，需要进行一系列的操作，包括表单数据的验证、数据类型的转换、将表单数据封装到 JavaBean 等，这些操作都是由 HandlerApater 来完成，开发者只需将注意力集中业务逻辑的处理上，DispatcherServlet 通过 HandlerAdapter 执行不同的 Handler。</li><li><strong>ModelAndView</strong>：装载了模型数据和视图信息，作为 Handler 的处理结果，返回给 DispatcherServlet。</li><li><strong>ViewResolver</strong>：视图解析器，DispatcherServlet 通过它将逻辑视图解析为物理视图，最终将渲染结果响应给客户端。</li></ul><h1 id="工作流程"><a href="#工作流程" class="headerlink" title="工作流程"></a>工作流程</h1><ul><li>客户端请求被 DisptacherServlet 接收。</li><li>根据 HandlerMapping 映射到 Handler。</li><li>生成 Handler 和 HandlerInterceptor。</li><li>Handler 和 HandlerInterceptor 以 HandlerExecutionChain 的形式一并返回给 DisptacherServlet。</li><li>DispatcherServlet 通过 HandlerAdapter 调用 Handler 的方法完成业务逻辑处理。</li><li>Handler 返回一个 ModelAndView 给 DispatcherServlet。</li><li>DispatcherServlet 将获取的 ModelAndView 对象传给 ViewResolver 视图解析器，将逻辑视图解析为物理视图 View。</li><li>ViewResovler 返回一个 View 给 DispatcherServlet。</li><li>DispatcherServlet 根据 View 进行视图渲染（将模型数据 Model 填充到视图 View 中）。</li><li>DispatcherServlet 将渲染后的结果响应给客户端。</li></ul><img src= "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/posts/Spring/image-20220228181850318.png" style="zoom:120%;" /><p>Spring MVC 流程非常复杂，实际开发中很简单，因为大部分的组件不需要开发者创建、管理，只需要通过配置文件的方式完成配置即可，真正需要开发者进行处理的只有 <strong>Handler</strong> 、<strong>View</strong>，还包括 <strong>Model</strong>。</p><h1 id="如何使用-Spring-MVC？"><a

Java 中时独立存在的一种结构，和类相似，我们需要创建一个接口文件，Java 中用 class 关键字来标识类，用 interface 来标识接口，基本语法：</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span

abstract 可以省略</u>。</p><p>接口中允许定义成员变量，但是有如下要求：</p><ol><li><p>不能定义 private 和 protected 修饰的成员变量，只能定义 public 和 默认访问权限修饰符 修饰的成员变量。</p></li><li><p>接口中的成员变量在定义时就必须完成初始化（赋值）。</p></li><li><p>接口中的成员变量都是静态常量，即可以直接通过接口访问，同时值不能被修改。</p></li></ol><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span

的每一个类，通过方法重写和多态让整个 Java 体系具有很强的灵活性。</p><p>包装类是 Java 为基本数据类型提供封装的一组类，通过包装类我们可以将基本数据类型转为对象，这一点在面向对象编程中很重要。</p><p>接口是抽象类的扩展，是 Java 中实现多态的重要方式，可以降低程序的耦合性，让程序变得更加灵活多变。接口就相当于零件，我们可以自由地将这些零件进行组装、整合。</p><p>异常是 Java 中处理错误的一种机制，同样是基于面向对象的思想，将错误抽象成对象然后进行处理，这里需要关注的是对异常相关的几个关键字的使用，try、catch、finally、throw、throws。</p><h2 id="多线程"><a

id="多线程-2"><a href="#多线程-2" class="headerlink" title="多线程"></a>多线程</h3><p>多线程是指在一个进程中，多个线程同时执行，这里说的同时执行并不是真正意义的同时执行。</p><p>系统会为每个线程分配 CPU 资源，在某个具体的时间段内 CPU 资源会被一个线程占用，在不同的时间段内由不同的线程来占用 CPU 资源，<strong>所以多个线程还是在交替执行，只不过因为 CPU 运行速度太快，我们感觉是在同时执行。</strong></p><p><img src= "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/img/loading.gif"

表示没有清除标志位，当前对象没有中断。</p><p>当一个线程对象处于不同的状态时，中断机制也是不同的。</p><p>创建状态：实例化线程对象，不启动。</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span

的区别</p></blockquote><p>1、synchronized 自动上锁，自动释放锁，Lock 手动上锁，手动释放锁。</p><p>2、synchronized 无法判断是否获取到了锁，Lock 可以判断是否拿到了锁。</p><p>3、synchronized 拿不到锁就会一直等待，Lock 不一定会一直等待。</p><p>4、synchronized 是 Java 关键字，Lock 是接口。</p><p>5、synchronized 是非公平锁，Lock 可以设置是否为公平锁。</p><p>公平锁：很公平，排队，当锁没有被占用时，当前线程需要判断队列中是否有其他等待线程。</p><p>非公平锁：不公平，插队，当锁没有被占用时，当前线程可以直接占用，而不需要判断当前队列中是否有等待线程。</p><p>实际开发中推荐使用 Lock 的方式。</p><p>ReentrantLock 具备限时性的特点，可以判断某个线程在一定的时间段内能否获取到锁，使用 tryLock 方法，返回值是 boolean 类型，true 表示可以获取到锁，false 表示无法获取到锁。</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span

      <title>2021年度总结&amp;2022新年计划</title>
      <link href="/posts/54b28b41/"/>
      <url>/posts/54b28b41/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>这是一篇年更文章，目前是我博客里的第二篇新年计划。</p></blockquote><div class='poem'><div class='poem-title'>元日</div><div class='poem-author'>[宋] 王安石</div><p>爆竹声中一岁除，<br>春风送暖入屠苏。<br>千门万户曈曈日，<br>总把新桃换旧符。</p></div><h1 id="🐮-回顾-2021"><a href="#🐮-回顾-2021" class="headerlink" title="🐮 回顾 2021"></a>🐮 回顾 2021</h1><p>整个大三下学期在忙着重考，选了三门课，最终以64、65、100分离谱收场，两门进步，一门退步，幸运的是毕业成绩单上只显示最高分，真心不戳。7月份我参加了学院组织的暑期实训，学习效果很拉胯，因为我们学院瞎指挥培训老师，让他们疯狂拉进度，学习内容涵盖了很多个方向，果不其然，我什么都没学到，不过期间我自学了 Vue，否则一点收获都无。然后8-12月我就主要在备考雅思了，一般我这个英语水平其实好好学俩月，也就是每天花6个小时左右，完全可以考到6.5或7.0，但是我的效率非常低，中间有很多天没有学，别问，问就是上王者段位去了，不过打到王者段位就没玩了hh。9.22 这场雅思考试我考了5.5分，当时还是比较开心的，因为这是我第一次参加雅思考试，考前的我非常紧张，再加上社恐 Buff 的加成，考前几天我人都快紧张坏了，最担心的部分是我的口语，我怕 Part2 说不上话来很社恐，所以我在备考阶段花了很多时间在口语上。12.30 这一场雅思我考了6.0分，既开心又后悔，虽然比上次进步了0.5分，但是后悔浪费了很多时间，因为我那次的成绩中任一门小分提高0.5，我的总分就是6.5了，真的是血亏两千大洋。不过还好在春节之前（1.29）在第三次雅思考试中考过了，成功与雅思妹妹分手，开心呐。还有一个事是我2021最幸运也是最幸福的事情，就是遇到了我的真命天女，缘分妙不可言~</p><p>根据 2021Target 各大板块逐步分析总结：</p><p><img src= "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/posts/Annual_Target/2021Target.png" alt="2021Target"></p><h2 id="💪-Health"><a href="#💪-Health" class="headerlink" title="💪 Health"></a>💪 Health</h2><p><strong>健身</strong>：我是从2021年暑假开始决定好好锻炼，期间一直有在举哑铃，做俯卧撑，偶尔进行仰卧起坐，但也经常忘记锻炼，虽然整体没有达标，但是相比去年，手臂肌肉明显壮实、紧致了一些，再接再厉。体重上保持不变，还是145斤，没有完成增加5kg。</p><p><strong>营养</strong>：上半年有认真执行，下半年放松了。下半年换寝室后，没有饮水机，也懒得去问宿管阿姨要一个，所以几乎每天喝的都是农夫山泉和怡宝啊哈哈哈，我现在居然已经能适应喝冷水了，但大家可不要学我哦，可以说为以后出国做好了准备🙈。</p><p><strong>睡觉</strong>：没有一丝丝改变，可能没有课上，自己管不住自己，几乎每天晚睡晚起，自从有了对象后，有时候能从晚上聊到早上六点，打电话也能通宵打，回想一下好像也没聊啥实质内容，天马行空属于是，不过现在好了一点点，也许开始缓慢进入平淡期了。</p><h2 id="✍-Learning"><a href="#✍-Learning" class="headerlink" title="✍ Learning"></a>✍ Learning</h2><p>第二大板块<strong>学习</strong>，英语方面，2021年二月份六级出分了，很开心，结果是426，低分飘过，直接原地起飞哈哈哈，不敢发朋友圈，怕刺激到那些没有过的同学，其实现在想想，也没必要为他人考虑太多，发就完事了，自己考不过怪我发朋友圈了不成？2021年考了两次雅思，一次5.5，一次6.0，但是在2022春节之前考过了（6.5分），其中听力还是7.0，可喜可贺！算是给我的新年礼物吧，对象很开心很满意。词汇量的话，还是七八千徘徊，现在我已经不太想背单词了，很浪费时间，还不如刷题，没有一万词汇量其实雅思照样可以过，我会在今年计划中去除词汇量，因为我逐渐发现，词汇虽然那一刻背会了，但是你不使用的话，忘得非常快，所以我倾向于多接触和英语相关的东西，不会的单词查就完事，如果有些单词在你眼里刷足了存在感的话，那么恭喜你，你一定会把它们记得很牢固。</p><p>计算机上，学习任务没有完成好，现在当事人很后悔，在毕设的压迫下，不得不逼自己一把，把过去没掌握的知识好好夯实下。均分上面，我大三下真的费老大的劲，才把均分提高了1分，毕竟是三年的平均成绩，想提一分还是蛮难的。我前两年一直在追求爱好，学业只是带着在搞，成绩和排名只是在中游，现在冲到了中游偏上，还是挺不容易的，小有进步。然后，我的学习效率低到爆炸，一个雅思妹妹，我能陪她半年，别人直接一两个月速速分手，说来惭愧，但是学习期间偷偷上了个王者也是不错的（dog.jpg）。证书上面，软考和计算机四级都放弃了，时间全部用来提均分和考雅思去了，蓝桥杯大赛也没怎么准备，水了个省二等奖，太丢人了。技能方面，恋爱技能算不？我还专门去看了看恋爱方面的书籍才打开了我尘封21年的心。说到这里，我2021年12月为了女朋友专门自学了织围巾，连雅思都不咋复习了，但是结果是好的，她还蛮喜欢吃的，敏感肌也可以用哦，已经订了一百条（<del>开个玩笑</del>）。</p><h2 id="💴-Income"><a href="#💴-Income" class="headerlink" title="💴 Income"></a>💴 Income</h2><p>第四大板块<strong>收入</strong>，大四上学期拿了三等奖学金，说实话不得不感慨班上大佬太多了，本以为自己的综测分很高，结果发现还有更高的，还高的离谱，人外有人啊，当然了，还是得说一句，综测分不重要，学到知识很重要。然后给别人批改雅思作文练练手，居然还拿到了一点小报酬，以后可以开小工作室了属于是，不，我太拉了，keep learning。大学这个阶段本人认为，收入是次要的，以后在社会上混出来了，周薪都可以抵我大学 4 年小打小闹赚的，<del>传统功夫点到为止。</del></p><h2 id="😀-External-amp-Internal"><a href="#😀-External-amp-Internal" class="headerlink" title="😀 External &amp; Internal"></a>😀 External &amp; Internal</h2><p>第六大板块<strong>外延与内涵</strong>，外延方面，希望新的一年自己的仪容仪表得体即可，表现上彬彬有礼，谈吐上不吐芬芳，<del>这是什么奇怪要求</del>。在家时我比较邋遢和随意，在校会正常些，天哪，我感觉几年没有正儿八经网购衣服鞋子了，第一懒得去看，第二穷，第三每次看都没有心仪的，所以就索性不买了。再来谈谈内涵方面，我心态一直保持着积极向上阳光开朗，可能有时候容易被失败给绊倒然后质疑自己的能力，很长一段时间处于emo状态，不过这种事情到了最后还是烟消云散，最终能够调整好自己心态。</p><h2 id="📹-Video"><a href="#📹-Video" class="headerlink" title="📹 Video"></a>📹 Video</h2><p>第七大板块<strong>视频</strong>，2021年好像就帮我对象剪了个比赛要用的视频，也没什么project。然后本想着再学一点拍摄剪辑的技巧，但是我的重心放到了自己的专业和雅思学习上了，还有谈恋爱去了，不过不遗憾，因为这只是一个爱好而已，需要用的时候在继续学习技巧。</p><h2 id="🎵-Music"><a href="#🎵-Music" class="headerlink" title="🎵 Music"></a>🎵 Music</h2><p>第八大版块<strong>音乐</strong>。看了看年初的计划，比较心寒，我当时脑子一热，想在网易云平台发2首嘻哈歌曲，其实歌词旋律都确定好了，demo也录出来了，但是一直再拖，项目也就鸽了，但不算烂尾，因为以后有时间精力的话还是可以完成的，把它改编亿下送给我的女朋友，她曾跟我说她有个朋友就给自己女朋友写歌了，俺也要整hh！</p><p>2021确实学唱了一些嘻哈单曲，其实只是为了开心，学会唱一些很帅的歌自己很有成就感。写到这里突然觉得很奇怪，学会唱一首歌怎么算是新年计划了哈哈哈，不过尊重不同时期的想法吧。</p><blockquote><p>2021 这一年在目标完成上勉强及格吧，其实可以看到很多最初定的目标都没有完成好，最大原因就是效率问题吧，还是那句话：“走起来了就有风”，我经常容易陷入懒惰之中，其实只要着手开始去做，效率就会慢慢地提升，对我来说还蛮试用的。收获也是有的，最令我自豪、开心、印象深刻地是遇到我人生中的 Ms.Right、被海外名校录取、考过雅思。以上就是我对 2021 的总结。</p></blockquote><h1 id="🐯-展望-2022"><a href="#🐯-展望-2022" class="headerlink" title="🐯 展望 2022"></a>🐯 展望 2022</h1><p><img src= "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/posts/Annual_Target/2022Target.png" alt="2022Target"></p><p>今年的计划与往年有些不同，其实就是有些目标已经完成了，所以不用再写啦，取而代之的是新计划。</p><p>Health 方面，有一些小变化，比如睡眠时间稍稍往后调了一下，其实人不能一口吃一个胖子，慢慢调整作息，然后健身的话就只要求自己做做俯卧撑即可，因为下半年在国外是家里是没有器材的，自己也不会去健身房，我其实不算是健身爱好者，这是有一点小想法而已，然后我的手臂实在是需要练练了，目前依旧瘦弱，什么时候能壮起来呢？</p><p>Learning 方面，在英语上继续提升自己，在计算机上开始有一个清晰的方向了，因为我已决定好毕业了走前端开发方向，所以前端的知识必须要牢牢掌握，然后今天下半年希望自己能够快速适应国外生活环境并在研究生期间取得不错的成果。</p><p>Income 方面，由于自己下半年要出国留学，费用这一块有很大的压力，不得不通过兼职来缓解，所以可以考虑当当线上辅导老师之类的兼职。兼职的同时也不要忘了自己出国的主要任务是学习专业知识哦。</p><p>Love 方面，在国内由于疫情影响，无法和女朋友外出旅游，而且才谈了不久还是异地，就更无法保证出国前能够一起旅旅游，于是想着咋俩研究生期间可以在当地国家转一转。今年的话，我想继续给女朋友送一些有纪念意义的礼物，理工男也要保持浪漫！毕竟以后回忆起都是满满的幸福，而不是：“这是我N朋友在网上随便乱买的，一点心都没有哎😪”。</p><p>External &amp; Internal 和 Music 方面没什么好说。Video 方面去掉了剪辑板块，因为这一年大概率是没有时间精力去继续学习剪辑技巧，说实话，拍照片真的很省时省力，咔嚓一下完成，剪辑的话就太费时了，目前还是学业重要。</p><p>一年又一年啊，新的一年希望能学到好多新的知识、新的技能，人生就是不断学习的过程，继续成长吧，小伙子。</p><blockquote><p><strong>结束语</strong>：</p><p>这就是我人生中的 2021 - 2022，期待一年后崭新的自己。<br>“苟日新，日日新，又日新”——《礼记·大学》</p></blockquote>]]></content>

代表焦距。</li><li><strong>AF /MF</strong>：AF 是自动对焦，MF 是手动对焦。</li><li><strong>Φ67mm</strong>：是镜头的一个口径。镜头的口径又叫“有效口径”、“有效孔径”，时表示镜头的最大进光孔，也就是镜头的最大光圈。“口径”通过常采用最大光孔直径与焦距的比值表示。</li><li><strong>1:3.5-5.6</strong>：指变焦下最大光圈浮动为 3.5 和 5.6。</li><li><strong>IS</strong>：镜头的稳定器，起到防抖的作用，IS 级别越高，防抖效果越好。</li><li><strong>STM</strong>：步进马达，多用在套机头上。</li><li><strong>USM</strong>：超声波马达，对焦安静快速。</li><li><strong>EF</strong>：全画幅镜头。全画幅也叫 35mm 或者 135 全画幅相机，大概为 36mm×24mm 大小。全画幅相机就很好的平衡了相机的体积与画质，这也是全画幅相机受欢迎的原因。</li><li><strong>EF-S</strong>：半画幅镜头。半画幅面积约为全画幅的一半，又叫残画幅，c 画幅，非全画幅，APS-C 画幅, 与胶片时代 APS 胶卷尺寸相同。最常见的半画幅相机是 APS-C 画幅相机的感光原件尺寸 22.2<em>14.8mm 或 22.7</em>15.5mm 左右，全画幅的感光元件尺寸大约是半画幅相机的 2.3 倍。</li></ul><p><img src= "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/img/loading.gif"

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>高中大学以来，我一直有个疑问，为什么周围同学洗澡的费用是我的两倍甚至以上，我夏季平均四五毛，冬季平均一块五，其他同学都是两三块，但经过我长时间断断续续的思考以及和朋友闲聊后，突然明白了真相hh</p></blockquote><h1 id="原因"><a href="#原因" class="headerlink" title="原因"></a>原因</h1><blockquote><p>总共分为以下3个原因</p></blockquote><h2 id="身高"><a href="#身高" class="headerlink" title="身高"></a>身高</h2><p>大家应该都有过洗澡时蹲着捡肥皂的经历，或者某个步骤需要弯腰，这时你会发现水温好像凉了一大截，其实水在快速喷射过程中温度会快速趋同于环境温度，你离花洒越远，温度就越接近于环境温度。由此可推，你长得越高，身体离喷洒就会越近，触肤的水温就会更接近于管道水原本的热度，你就越不需要调高水温，于是热水消耗相对少，费用就相对低<img no-lazy class="inline" src= "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zhheo/Sticker-Heo@main/Sticker-100/%E7%8B%97%E5%A4%B4.png" style="height:1.5em"/>。故，身高越高，费用相对越低。</p><h2 id="洗澡方式"><a href="#洗澡方式" class="headerlink" title="洗澡方式"></a>洗澡方式</h2><p>本篇文章只考虑淋浴，相当一部分人喜欢一手拿毛巾，一手拿花洒，我个人认为，一只手擦身体的效率是低于双手的，虽说拿着花洒可以精确将水冲到某些部位，但是用水冲配合效率低下的单手去擦，整体看来，费水费时费钱。墙壁上的挂扣：？我应该钻到地缝😭。我的习惯就是偶尔手拿花洒，大部分时间都是挂墙壁上的，这样效率相对会高。</p><blockquote><p><strong>有意思的事情</strong>：</p><p>想知道我咋知道室友的洗澡方式吗？因为我洗完，墙壁上只有少量的水珠，我发现室友洗完墙壁上甚至窗户上全特么都是水珠（抛开水蒸气因素不谈），我不得不脑补，我室友是在里边洗边跳街舞吗？经过一番闲聊后，我得知，原来我室友的确喜欢手拿花洒，并且“手舞足蹈”。</p></blockquote><h2 id="洗澡习惯"><a href="#洗澡习惯" class="headerlink" title="洗澡习惯"></a>洗澡习惯</h2><p>因人而异，有些人觉得洗的久一点，水开到最大，舒服些，更干净点，或者Ta做任何事都是慢吞吞的，洗澡也不例外，自然而然水费较高。有些人觉得没必要在洗澡上浪费太多时间、做事效率要高，或觉得搓那几下足够洗干净，故水费较低。我在学校洗澡的话，确实有节约用水的想法在里面，所以每次不会冲很久，这也使得我洗澡费用较低。</p><blockquote><p>结束语：</p><p>本篇就当老朋友唠嗑啦，最后，节约用水是种美德，走起~</p></blockquote>]]></content>

      <title>iPhone13香吗？聊聊我的使用感受</title>
      <link href="/posts/8e70e235/"/>
      <url>/posts/8e70e235/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>我是 9.28 号官网下单 iPhone 13，10.14 号到，可把我等的啊 🤣</p></blockquote><p>上一部我用的是荣耀 Play，用到一年半的时候开始感到卡顿，然后愈发不可收拾，期间我用了很多方法，如卸载不常用 APP，转移媒体文件到电脑中，甚至恢复出厂设置过 2 次，于是勉强又撑了一年半，而现在实在顶不住于是冲了“预谋已久”的 iPhone 13。</p><p>谈一谈 iPhone 13 我的使用感受吧，首先是<strong>页面</strong>，我觉得它的各种切换动画很流畅，善用各种颜色，每个自带 APP 页面基本上是黑白灰再搭配一个主题色，整体设计很符合我的审美，有一种简约高级感，尤其再搭配上那经典的毛玻璃页面。美中不足的是 13 要是像 Pro 那样有高刷就好，不求 120Hz，90 也行啊。</p><p>再说说<strong>外观</strong>，很多人不喜欢这个硬朗直板的手机轮廓，但我还挺喜欢的，超瓷晶面板加上航空级铝金属边框，我觉得整体观感很干净利落，手感实实在在。然后它的刘海屏也是饱受争议，今年居然还进步了，刘海面积相比 iPhone 12 缩小了 20%，其实我不在乎刘海的有无，不影响正常功能使用就行（<del>经典苹果用户的包容</del>）。</p><p>背后的<strong>摄像头</strong>采取了对顶角布局，镜头模组面积保持不变的情况下，镜头相较于去年大了一点，我觉得 iPhone 13 的拍出来的照片质量还行，前天我同学过生日，我给他拍许愿照时，我发现火焰拍得很清晰，火焰边缘锐化的不错，尤其和我另一个同学 iPhone X 拍的对比后，但依然存在绿色鬼影 😅，希望 iPhone 未来系列能解决这个问题。然后它的超广角我也挺喜欢，以后有空可以在户外试试，拍些有镜头拉伸感的照片。</p><p><strong>APP</strong>的话，谈谈两个我喜欢的苹果自带 APP 吧，第一个是<u>库乐队</u>，当然我去年在 iPad 2020 里就体验过，对于我这种喜欢音乐的小白来说，无疑是个上手快、对新手友好的编曲 APP，当然要编得好听还得学学乐理。第二个是<u>快捷指令</u>🎉，你可以自定义一系列手机操作，超级方便，比如一键打开微信扫码、健康码等等。也可以写些自动化脚本，比如每天早上八点准时播放音乐、手机充满电时播放声音提醒你拔掉充电头等等，最近几天研究了一下快捷指令，简直程序员狂喜，很亲切，不过对非程序员人群也比较友好，起码都是中文，稍微了解一下，就可以写出很多快捷指令，它将会给你生活带来很大的便利。要说缺点的话，我觉得有些自带 APP 对国内用户不太友好，也许被我国禁了，在国外才能正常使用。</p><p>再说说 <strong>IOS 15 的新功能</strong>，我最喜欢的是它能通过 AI 自动识别图片，假若某天你需要找你家猫猫的照片，直接在搜索栏里打上“猫”就可以找到和猫相关的图片，非常方便，不用在若干张图片里一个一个找。</p><p>最后，谈谈其它方面——<strong>电量</strong>，个人感觉充电速度挺快的，至少和我前任对比的话，然后它充到 80%时会自动开启涓流模式以保护电池。待机时长我觉得很满意，虽电池容量小，但整体耗电较少，使用上不会让我有电量危机。再说说<strong>信号</strong>，这个得吐槽吐槽，在寝室里偶尔会没有信号，我目前只希望，以后支付和展示健康码时不要突然断网！那样我会非常尴尬脚趾抓地。</p><p>13 建不建议买呢？我觉得还是因人而异，按需考虑是否购买。再回答下本文标题——iPhone13 香吗？综合考虑的话，我觉得香。</p>]]></content>

      <title>一些想对大学新生说的话</title>
      <link href="/posts/5f9fb916/"/>
      <url>/posts/5f9fb916/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>只有走过一些路才觉得大学中有好多事情可以做得更好，不一定是后悔吧。本篇分享我在大学中得出的一些经验，即将上大学或者已经上了大学的童鞋们可以看看。</p></blockquote><h1 id="社团篇"><a href="#社团篇" class="headerlink" title="社团篇"></a><p align="center">社团篇<p></h1><p>我就统一称为社团吧，包括学生会、xx队、xx团、xx协会等等。有些人的想法可能是：“我要拥有更多的时间好好学习，高考没考好，想上个好的研究生院校。。。”，这个想法很不错，很多学生都有，这样的话你确实拥有更多的时间支配到学习上，但对于相当一部分人来说只是一个借口罢了，真正做到把大部分时间花在学习上的少之又少。你能保证你的学习能够延续高中的那种强度吗？能够做到每天花8小时高效学习吗？有较强的自制力吗？我自己是那种如果没有人管着、不断给自己任务的话就会玩的人，加入社团后，自己确实很忙，但是我看到自己的时间能够被充分利用到就很有成就感。</p><p>当然，如果对大学社团没有兴趣或没有想法本小节可以跳过哈。</p><h2 id="加入社团积极的一面"><a href="#加入社团积极的一面" class="headerlink" title="加入社团积极的一面"></a>加入社团积极的一面</h2><p>社团有很多种类别，我大概划分下，有兴趣类、学习类、志愿服务类等。首先，几乎每个社团都能丰富你的阅历，认识到很多志同道合的人；其次，参加社团在满足你爱好的同时，又能给你每学年的各种学生测评中加分。</p><h2 id="加入社团消极的一面"><a href="#加入社团消极的一面" class="headerlink" title="加入社团消极的一面"></a>加入社团消极的一面</h2><p>如果你的时间管理能力不强，那么社团组织的一些活动或者任务可能会成为你学习道路上的绊脚石。如果能够合理地分配时间，社团活动反而会充实你的大学生活，我大学里的某哥们就是很典型的例子，它大一加入了五个社团，但他的成绩依然能在专业名列前茅，最后还能保研985，当然他也有完成不了、做不到位的时候，比如开会时经常迟到，一些被安排的事情经常拖延，尽管最终还是能够勉强完成，但在这里不建议友友们效仿。</p><h2 id="合理地选择社团"><a href="#合理地选择社团" class="headerlink" title="合理地选择社团"></a>合理地选择社团</h2><p>在此我推荐参加一个兴趣类的和一个学习类的社团。在选择社团时，有很多因素可以考虑，比如这个社团平时活动多吗？多/少到什么程度？是校级还是院级社团？可以学到什么知识/技巧？还有一些不那么重要的因素，比如你的朋友或同学在里面，你也想去，可以做个伴；或者里面女生多、男生多，这些都是可以考虑的。</p><h3 id="选择兴趣类还是学习类社团？"><a href="#选择兴趣类还是学习类社团？" class="headerlink" title="选择兴趣类还是学习类社团？"></a>选择兴趣类还是学习类社团？</h3><p>这个问题针对于<u>只想选择一个社团</u>的童鞋。你在高中高强度地学了三年，好不容易来到大学，肯定想着要追求自己心底埋藏多年的爱好，所以博主我大一时脑子一热就加入了剪辑部和舞蹈队，都是我的爱好之一，前者隶属于院学生会，后者隶属于校艺术团，都是其所属组织里最累的社团，<span class="hide-inline"><button type="button" class="hide-button" style="">更多吐槽内容   </button><span class="hide-content">先说说剪辑部，我经常肝视频肝到凌晨，万一电脑卡的死机，而且视频没有保存的话那就完蛋了。再说说舞蹈队，它主要负责为学校里各大舞台提供艺术节目，如果没有节目任务的话，我们就一周四天中午聚集在舞蹈室练一个多小时的基本功，其中两天练古典或现代舞，两天练街舞，下午第一二节课我直接昏昏欲睡，而且中午只有半小时时间给你下课飞奔到食堂、吃饭、从食堂飞奔到舞蹈室，如果有节目的话，那就要挤出更多的时间来排练舞蹈节目，甚至会让你推掉一些其它不重要的活动来进行舞蹈排练，一般一个舞蹈节目要排很久，动作好不容易学会了，还要排队形、扣动作细节和质感，我们经常在舞蹈室排上大半天的时间，晚上十点多回去甚至没有热水洗澡，我有时还挺羡慕合唱队、曲艺队，也羡慕能无忧无虑待在宿舍打游戏追剧的室友们。说了这么多吐槽，但是还是有很多收获的，比如爱好、友谊、学分、在简历或者各种申请上可以写的经历等等，付出的一切又是那么值得</span></span>。选兴趣类社团是个很好的选择，除了它还可以选择学习类的，比如和你专业相关的学习社团，你进去了之后多少会对自己的专业技能提升有很大帮助，平时还可以组团参加学科竞赛，默默地说一句，在综合测评和学分置换上，学科竞赛获奖所加的分远远多于参加一些社团活动，比如你xxx大赛获得一等奖加8分，参加xxx活动签到几乎都加1分，然后再乘以权重，学习类权重55%，文体类权重10%，这么算的话，你一个竞赛获一等奖相当于参加44次活动签到，当然了也不是说参加了一个学科竞赛，加分就无敌无解了，因为你准备一个学科竞赛，得花无数个日日夜夜不断的学习，也许是100到200个小时，但你参加一个活动也许只会花掉你1到2个小时的时间。这么来看，其实无论是选择兴趣类还是学习类社团都各有千秋，不过，我的建议还是优先考虑学习类，兴趣这种东西不一定需要加入社团，毕竟上大学出来还是要出来工作的嘛，否则你毕业后迷茫的样子很难堪，兴趣爱好这种东西什么时候追求都为时不晚，有很多二三十岁的成年人还不是在舞室学街舞。</p><h3 id="选择校级还是院级社团？"><a href="#选择校级还是院级社团？" class="headerlink" title="选择校级还是院级社团？"></a>选择校级还是院级社团？</h3><h4 id="校级社团优势"><a href="#校级社团优势" class="headerlink" title="校级社团优势"></a>校级社团优势</h4><p>在校级社团你可以认识到来自各个学院的同学，可以扩大你的人脉网，然后在综合测评和学分置换上，校级活动的加分普遍多于院级。</p><h4 id="院级社团优势"><a href="#院级社团优势" class="headerlink" title="院级社团优势"></a>院级社团优势</h4><p>在院级社团你能够认识到本学院的很多同学，可以在专业学习上互帮互助、交流知识，因为很多本学院其它专业的学同学可能和你上的是同一门课，有时候分组做项目时，你可以快速找到自己认识的同学来组队。</p><blockquote><p>最终无论选择了什么样的社团，或者没有参加都是可以的，只要你有能够说服自己不后悔的理由就行。</p></blockquote><h1 id="爱好篇"><a href="#爱好篇" class="headerlink" title="爱好篇"></a><p align="center">爱好篇<p></h1><p>其实通过参加社团来追求爱好是一种方式，你也可以私下花时间自学，或者报个班，如果你有社交牛逼症的话，自己去结交相同兴趣的盆友也是可以的。在大学有太多的爱好可以追求，比如琴棋书画、游戏、跑酷、滑板、轮滑、B-BOX、涂鸦、说唱、街舞、武术、运动、健身、二次元、拍摄、剪辑等等。但注意一点，时间管理很重要！学业优先！</p><h1 id="外貌篇"><a href="#外貌篇" class="headerlink" title="外貌篇"></a><p align="center">外貌篇<p></h1><p>到了大学，是时候打扮打扮自己。很多人应该受够了高中统一的服装和受限的发型吧，到了大学可以尝试以前不敢想的风格，我很多以前的同学到了大学像变了一个人，有的人变得非常漂亮、非常帅气，有的人甚至以前瘦不拉几，到了大学摇身变健身教练。</p><h1 id="情感篇"><a href="#情感篇" class="headerlink" title="情感篇"></a><p align="center">情感篇<p></h1><p>说到这里，真是惭愧555，作为SOLO人士没有什么经验给到友友们，我觉得在大学谈恋爱是很浪漫的一件事，不像幼小初高那样，还得偷偷摸摸地，不被老师家长发现，然后如果在职场上面找对象的话，当然是没有在大学里谈那么无忧无虑，步入社会后你得考虑房车工资等等现实问题。如果在大学里遇到天命之子/女，就主动出击吧啊哈哈，当然能不能走到最后，除了外观还得看三观合不合，未来规划是否一致等等。最后，自重吧。（2021.12.8 我恋爱了哈哈，在大学的末尾找到了真爱）</p><h1 id="旅游篇"><a href="#旅游篇" class="headerlink" title="旅游篇"></a><p align="center">旅游篇<p></h1><p>好不容易来到了大学，起码得把您大学所在城市周围玩个遍，否则别人来你这玩，你连周围有什么吃喝玩乐都不了解，那还怎么给别人介绍。可以花时间，比如劳动节、国庆节、寒暑假和好朋友出去旅个游什么的，一些小假就憋回家了吧，在家都待18年了还回去干甚呢？哈哈</p><h1 id="英语篇"><a href="#英语篇" class="headerlink" title="英语篇"></a><p align="center">英语篇<p></h1><p>四六级越早过越好，因为你刚高考完，趁英语还有点余温，赶紧把四六级考过。如果你要考研的话，英语还是要带着学，可以定期花时间刷刷题，背背单词，可以三天学一次英语，甚至一周学一次英语，重点是一定要定期学习，保持英语语感，否则你高中学过的英语知识都会随时间流逝被你忘掉，像我现在高中物理化学生物几年没碰，现在基本忘干净了。</p><h1 id="证书篇"><a href="#证书篇" class="headerlink" title="证书篇"></a><p align="center">证书篇<p></h1><p>不知道您有没有听过一些类似的话：“上了大学，一定要参加竞赛拿各种证书”。参加学科竞赛是首要的，证书的话，像四六级、普通话等等学校要求的可以拿拿，然后专业相关证书可以拿拿，其它不太重要的证，就不用去为了加学分而去拿，显得很狼狈，有这个时间还不如花在学科竞赛的准备上或者提高自己专业硬实力上。</p><h1 id="专业篇"><a href="#专业篇" class="headerlink" title="专业篇"></a><p align="center">专业篇<p></h1><p>一般是大一上一些公共课，大一下或者大二开始上专业课。在这里我想说，专业课一定要好好上啊，无论你采取什么学习方法，只要适合自己，冲就完了，因为专业课一般都是一环套一环的，你一个知识点或者一门学科没有学好，到后面你会发现很多课都跟不上了，正所谓书到用时方恨少，你得花更多时间来弥补。</p><h1 id="留学篇"><a href="#留学篇" class="headerlink" title="留学篇"></a><p align="center">留学篇<p></h1><p>平时就要和老师保持良好关系，多问老师问题，这样你留学申请时Ta可以帮你写推荐信。</p><p>然后对于语言的话，今早学习你要去对国家的语言吧，和英语四六级不冲突的，可以同时学习，尽量在大四之前过语言这关，大四上就可以安心申请海外院校了。</p><p>GPA、四年的平均成绩也很重要，它是留学申请中所需要参考的因素之一。在这里我的建议是，平时多花时间在学位课以及课程学分高的课上，否则会出现别人均分比你低零点几，但GPA却比你高零点几，这个时候，学位课分很高的作用就体现了。</p><h1 id="考研篇"><a href="#考研篇" class="headerlink" title="考研篇"></a><p align="center">考研篇<p></h1><p>虽然这不是我的选择，但还是给一些我的拙见。一般大三就开始着手准备考研了，先是学习数学、英语，再是专业内容，大三暑假和大四上开始学习政治。</p><h1 id="工作篇"><a href="#工作篇" class="headerlink" title="工作篇"></a><p align="center">工作篇<p></h1><p>大三下就要开始找实习找工作了，你得考虑你将来打算在哪个方向/领域工作，然后提前学习那个方向的知识。还得提前了解工作面试时会问到一些内容，得做好准备，其实大一就可以开始考虑这个事情了。</p><h1 id="毕设篇"><a href="#毕设篇" class="headerlink" title="毕设篇"></a><p align="center">毕设篇<p></h1><p>一般是大三下联系老师带你做毕业设计，首先你得询问老师是哪个方向的，如果感兴趣且你也挺喜欢那个老师的话，那就不用犹豫了，直接选择 Ta 吧，不然晚了，就被其他同学选完了。</p><h1 id="其它经验"><a href="#其它经验" class="headerlink" title="其它经验"></a><p align="center">其它经验<p></h1><p>四年下来，我发现了一个问题，就是你参加的每一个活动、每一个比赛，拿到的每一个奖，学到的每一个知识、技术，对你都会是一种良性循环。比如，我拿到了xxx证书/奖状，无论是下一次综合测评，还是下一次学分置换，都有加分作用，你综测分高了，拿到了奖学金，会间接促使你在后续一系列各种各样的学生评测中出类拔萃，然后你工作了，学校的一些经历也是可以写上去的。此外，再说说知识/技术，以我为例，我专业是大二开始学如何建站，我当时没有好好学，于是呢？截止现在，共有5门课（包括各种实训）都需要用到Web相关知识，每一次结课都非常后悔，不知多少次重拾信心决定好好看网课学技术，全都浅尝辄止，直到毕业设计来临，我一咬咬牙，就突然学会搭建网站哈哈哈，很开心，真是不到棺材不落泪，所以大学生们一定要好好学知识啊，你想想，你要是大二学会了，之后的每一门相关课程，你岂不是游刃有余？节省下来的时间，你可以用来学习更多的知识，说实话，我的这个专业，认真完成课程设计的人不到20%。。。幸好这个博客的存在让我巩固并运用到了以前自学的前端知识，否则Web我是一窍不通hhh。</p><blockquote><p>最后，祝大家在大学期间顺顺利利，实现自己的目标和理想。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>有时候搜索一些问题，很多点进去的网站都看起来眼花缭乱，关键是里面穿插着各种小广告，二维码，跳转链接，但你又不是站长，也没有办法去改别人的网站，那怎么办呢？</p><p>友友们可能会想到可以安装去除广告的插件，说到这我分享一篇我看过的文章：<a href="https://blog.zhheo.com/p/8818601d.html">Heomagic 08 | Chrome 网页去广告插件推荐</a>，大家有兴趣可以试试该文章推荐的插件。如果友友们有更好用的插件麻烦留言告诉俺。</p><p>本篇就说说我最近发现的小妙招，话说某天我突然在 Cent 浏览器设置中看到了<code>样式文件</code>按钮，于是象征性的写了一些 CSS 代码并把文件上传进去，发现果然能控制网页的样式，我猜这个设置的最初目的是想让有能力的人自定义更改一些常用页面的外观，比如给搜索页面换个自己喜欢的背景什么的。但这些我都不感冒，我只想通过 CSS 代码去掉一些常用网页的广告，说白了就是<u>利用类名或 ID 定位到组件，再写个 display: none;就完事</u>。</p><p><img src= "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/posts/TooMuchAds/Snipaste_2021-10-05_16-59-30.png" alt="Cent Browser"></p><p>代码示例：</p><figure class="highlight css"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&lt;<span class="selector-tag">Custom</span> &gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attribute">display</span>: none;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>如果对 CSS 不了解，建议稍微学一下噢~</p><p><strong>优点</strong>：能自定义屏蔽内容，不一定是广告，也可以是其它不想看到的内容</p><p><strong>缺点</strong>：</p><ol><li>不适配所有浏览器。目前发现只有 Cent 浏览器有样式设置，Chrome、Edge 里没有找到</li><li>网页加载速度不会因为没有广告而变快。<code>display: none;</code>的缺点大家也知道，虽可屏蔽您选中的组件，但网页还是得加载一次它，不过问题不大。</li><li>给每个网页写屏蔽代码很累。在这里建议最好对你常用的网站，针对性地写 CSS 屏蔽代码，否则太累了，这也是缺点所在。同时，不同的网站命名风格不同，世上所有的站长不会都傻里傻气的给广告整一个<code>advertisement</code>的类名或 ID 吧？一小段代码能屏蔽所有网站的广告那还得了，听懂掌声 👏</li></ol><p><strong>注意</strong>：根据类名或 ID 定位组件时，注意其精准性，指不定其它网站也有同名的组件，恰好那部分内容你又需要看。打个不恰当的比方，你直接把 div 给屏蔽掉了，这还像话吗？</p><p>虽然我的这个方法不能百分之百帮到所有看此篇文章的人，但能帮一个是一个 😀，至少我目前用的爱不释手哈哈哈，感觉寻到了宝藏。</p>]]></content>

      <title>作为一名家长该如何看待孩子择业问题？</title>
      <link href="/posts/b799e8a8/"/>
      <url>/posts/b799e8a8/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>说实话，取这标题时我也懵了，仿佛自己当过家长且十分有过来人的经验，然而并不是。有时候我对某些事情有着自己长期的观察与见解，并且想把这些想法记录下来，无论若干年后的自己会不会持反对意见，但我依然觉得很有必要。</p><p>（可能我当了家长并且孩子高考毕业后，我可能会继续在文章底下添加我的最新观点，但那得一二十年后了哈哈）</p></blockquote><p>前不久我和一个长辈谈过一个话题：孩子应该选择常见、好赚钱的专业，还是选择他喜欢，但不常见、看上去不好赚钱的职业呢？我们之间产生了很大的分歧，Ta 的想法其实和绝大多数中国家长一样，孩子有了好工作，孩子以后就过的好，家长也放心，家长的养老也有了保障，甚至会成为亲朋好友茶余饭后的谈资，最后还可能会把它归结于自己教育的成功。</p><p>以上观点我不完全反对，我认为任何一件事情不能过于绝对，<u>得根据实际情况来做一个合理的判断与抉择</u>。比如你是支持孩子选择自己喜欢，但不常见、看上去不好赚钱的职业，还是持否定态度？顺便提一下我和那个长辈谈论的实际案例是一个喜欢钻研历史政治的“成年孩子”（<del>在家长面前你永远是孩子</del>）。</p><p>要是我作为这类孩子的家长，我会怎么看呢？首先，得了解到孩子对这个专业领域有多了解或者有多大的兴趣爱好，如果 Ta 也摇摆不定，只是一时的爱好，那你应当尽可能的可以给出你作为过来人的经验与看法，建议他选择那些常见的、好赚钱的专业。如果 Ta 是真的非常喜欢这个专业，且你能够看到 Ta 平时为这个专业所做的一切，比如关注它的新闻常态、买周边书籍、看相关视频，如果到这种程度的话，我大概率会支持 Ta 的选择，尽管以后可能赚的钱没别人多，但只要你能健康快乐的活着，当家长的我就安心了。说说那个实际案例吧，那孩子是非常的喜欢历史政治，我觉得作为家长，你这边能做的就是告诉 Ta 你在担心什么，比如：“孩子将来也是要吃饭的呀，不能啃老一辈子，那我们老了谁来照顾啊？你是打算当一辈子历史政治老师吗？钻研这个它挣钱吗？”，同时也说说：“现在 XX 专业我觉得挺适合你的，它怎么怎么样的好...”，再看看孩子对这件事是怎么想的，多维度考虑这个择业问题，何况孩子都成年了，已经具备独立思考能力。同时也要注意沟通是一个双方的过程，家长这时要放低姿态，和孩子站在同一高度，要做到理性、心平气和，并有理有据地分析和给出观点，切记不要说两三句就怒气上头，这样非常不利于孩子专业的选择，也进一步加深了家庭关系的恶化。</p><p>如果 Ta 的想法是类似：“我不管你们晚年生活，我只在乎我的爱好”这样类似没有良心、孝心的话，家长这时得反思自己平时教育上是否存在某些漏洞，比如平时只关心自己不关注孩子的看法、只关心自己的工作而不关心孩子的学习等等类似行为，从而导致孩子眼里只有自己，对他人漠不关心。确实，当家长的的确不容易，不是每一个家长都是教育专家，他们所有人都是第一次当家长，且平时都在忙各种事情，导致家长在教育上付出的时间较少，当然也不是说你付出的多，你就一定能收获相应的回报，而你要用正确的方法去付出，达到四两拨千斤、一点就通的效果，教育这一块的东西，还是得花时间去学，而不是说：“过去，我自己的父母就是这么教育我的，所以我现在也要这么教育我的孩子”，要知道时代不同，咋们得与时俱进，活到老学到老。</p><p>另外如果家长不仅认为这个专业不赚钱，还讨厌这个专业，那你是不是该反思下自己这一二十年来和孩子到底有没有过充分的交流，你是否真的了解孩子？你是否经常向 Ta 灌输你的价值观？你是否经常和 Ta 分享你对某些事物的看法？你的孩子如今的择业观念或者价值观为什么和你有很大冲突？而不是把这一切归因于：“孩子真不懂事，翅膀硬了，都学会顶嘴了”。但从另一种角度看问题，想法不同也是一件好事，说明孩子长大了有自己独立思考能力，总是过于听话、百依百顺的孩子，可能童年过得很幸福，大人也很安心，但是长大成人后你会逐渐发现他们身上存在的一些不好习惯或性格，比如内向、没有主见、害怕责任等等，这些话题我在<a href="/posts/eb8364b4/">《童年很幸福，长大后却迷惘的“好孩子”们》</a>的读后感位置分析过。</p><p>总之，孩子择业问题还是得具体情况具体分析，不能妄下定论。本文章大篇幅都站在了家长的角度来讲，当然作为孩子的话，还是多理解下家长，双方多沟通，才能选择出合适的专业。</p>]]></content>

      <title>一个孩子的辉煌成就是归因于天赋吗？</title>
      <link href="/posts/cf85242b/"/>
      <url>/posts/cf85242b/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>最近看到了一则热搜新闻：<a href="https://s.weibo.com/weibo?q=%2314岁初中生考进清华成最小本科生%23&from=default">#14 岁初中生考进清华成最小本科生#</a> ，引起了网友的热议，我的一条评论也被众多网友回复，不乏有些低素质人群上来二话不说直接：“...你儿子大专吧？...”。我原评论大意是：“这不是天赋天才的问题，而是靠后天...”，然后本篇文章我打算再记录并详述下自己的一些拙见吧。</p><p>我觉得除了<strong>DNA</strong>能决定的之外，他如今的成就还与他家长老师的教育和自身努力有着很大的关系。至于很多人想表达：“是天赋问题，人到达一定学习境界，再怎么努力也不看到显著成效，这时天赋的优越就体现出来了”。且慢，我认为你们所谓的“天赋”也需要后天的培养，你的<strong>思维模式</strong>、<strong>爱好</strong>、<strong>性格</strong>、<strong>习惯</strong>几乎都是后天培养的，有些网友会觉得：“他学一遍就会，我还需要学好几遍”，于是自然而然归因于“天赋”。在这里我可以大胆的猜测，他小时候应该做过大量的思维训练，看过很多相关的书籍，也许父母会经常和他探讨学术相关问题，或许还会带他参观一些特定主题的博物馆，这一系列的因素逐渐铸造成了如今你们眼里的学神。</p><p>还有些网友说：“同样的初中三年，他就是学得快吗，分还比你高，你再怎么努力也无用”。要知道你们说的学习区间是放眼于整个初中三年，这么算的话那的确，那个学霸确实看上去相同学习时间内获得的分数更多，但你得知道磨刀不误砍柴工这个道理啊！你们却忽略了他小学甚至幼儿阶段的教育培养，比如专门培养了他对物理或奥数的爱好，还培养了他的学习能力、抗干扰能力等等，要知道一个人的学习能力强会起到事半功倍的效果，再加上有一些相关学科的底子，这就是为什么他上了初中后看上去快的异于常人，这正所谓良性循环，对于他来说，只会“越学越快，越辩越明”，这可能就是你们常挂嘴边的“天赋”、“天才”吧。</p><p>唉，看了一圈评论发现和我有共鸣的网友几乎没有，某种意义上是件好事，某种意义上也是件坏事。其实我一直以来秉承着一个观念：“只要你不是天生有缺陷，所有人生来都是一样的，唯一能改变 Ta 的，只可能是后天培养和他所处环境的影响”，再说了，何况很多残障人士还不是靠自己实现了自己人生的理想，还不是在他们的领域有所建树，虽说我们看到的可能是少数，但只要你想做出成就，终归是有办法的，人无论处于什么现实状态下，心态还是要积极起来，毕竟你只能活一次，为什么不能选择潇洒地过一生呢？与君共勉。</p><p>实话说，我不太喜欢“天赋”、“天才”这个词，我觉得更多的是对一个人努力的不尊重，当然啦，偶尔诙谐地调侃一下：“这孩子真有天赋，真是个天才呀”我觉得是可以的，但是假若你有这种类似想法，比如：“某某某就是有这方面的天赋，Ta 就是学的快，我们就是学不会，哎，就是玩”，我觉得这是在为自己学不会（<del>躺平</del>）而找理由！与其羡慕他有“天赋”，还不如多花时间思考下自己该如何达到某种目标，并不是说一定要达到那位学神的高度才是你们的最终目的，成功有很多种定义，你通过一系列努力达到了自己梦寐以求的目标后，我认为这样的你也是成功的！值得我们去尊重！</p><p>说到这里，我想到了“内卷”概念，这些话题我在<a href="/posts/49f4d334/">《终于有人把内卷讲明白了》</a>的读后感位置分析过，<u>仰望天空的同时也要脚踏实地，凡事要有自己的节奏，不盲目跟风加入内卷</u>。这位 14 岁少年已经到达了“天花板”高度，很多人就不由自主地在大脑里把他和自己初中三年作对比，甚至设想自己要学多少年，攒多少的劲，下多少功夫才能到达他的那个高度，想完之后呢，就感觉哎呀，太难了，啷个办嘛？哦豁，咦，原来他家这么有钱啊，他父母学历这么高啊，等等等等，所以才他才这么牛啊，唉，我家就没有这样的条件，所以我才没他强，于是心安理得地退出了新闻，一如既往地继续自己以前的生活，好像一切都没发生过。</p><p>当然以上内容也只是我通过有限的学识和有限的观察推理出来的。俗话说：“道理咋都懂，可就是做不到”，不知道以上我的见解让读者耳目一新了吗？但愿我的一些拙见能引发更多的思考和实际行动吧。</p><p>最后点下题，我认为<u>一个孩子的辉煌成就靠后天的培养和他所处的环境的影响</u>。</p>]]></content>

class="headerlink" title="“好孩子”的危险"></a><p align="center">“好孩子”的危险<p></h1><p>在我的童年时代，成年人世界对于“好孩子”的标准只有三个：<strong>第一，成绩好；第二，听话；第三，不谈恋爱。</strong></p><p>“成绩好”，是因为在那个时代，对普通家庭来说，这是唯一改变命运的方式。</p><p>当然，成绩好的孩子如果谈了恋爱，那也不再是“好孩子”。在那个集体禁欲的时代，我们的父母和社会竭力营造一种“无性”“干净”的环境。尤其到了青春期，我们的身体已经开始发育，性意识已经伴随着身体的发育开始觉醒，但对那时的我们来说，爱美是一件羞于启齿的事情，对身体的各种莫名尴尬与自卑则是青春期的普遍记忆。对于“性”的任何好奇心都是被禁止的。</p><p>我们从不谈论性，与任何人都不谈，就好像这件事情不存在一样。电视上偶尔看到搂搂抱抱甚至接吻的镜头，父母就会在我们彼此之间的心照不宣中把电视关掉。</p><div

class="image-caption">《小欢喜》剧照</span></div><p>还有，好孩子从不忤逆他们的父母。在我们的文化里，忤逆父母是不孝，是最大的恶。但现代心理学认为，<u>对父母的暴力情绪在一个人的成长过程中是很自然的</u>。尤其是在进入青春期的时候，孩子开始学习认知自我，探索和建立自己和他人以及世界之间的边界。<u>当他们觉得自己的边界受到侵犯的时候，就会奋起保护自己的边界</u>。</p><p><img align="right" style="zoom:40%;" src= "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/posts/Education/image-20210815124255118.png"/>英国心理学家唐纳德·温尼科特（Donald Woods Winnicott）认为，<u>一个孩子要想长大并发现自身本性中最深刻的部分，他的人生中必须有一个人能够包纳他所有的攻击性而仍然爱他</u>。“童年的意义就在于能表达很多坏的情绪而不至于有什么恶果和报应。”</p><p>所以，温尼科特很怕“好孩子”，<u>因为他们做一切大人认为他们应该做的事情，而这恰恰是问题所在——他们的“好”是一种必要，而非选择</u>。</p><p>是的，我们应该为孩子创造一个安全的环境。但是过于强调儿童的“脆弱性”是另一种危险的倾向——它为成年人的过度干涉提供了借口。很多时候，我们对孩子安全问题的偏执，<u>表面上是保护，实际上却构成了一种剥夺，剥夺孩子成长所需的正常而真实的环境</u>。</p><p>在这一切焦虑、不安的背后，是一种对儿童深深的误解——孩子如瓷器一样脆弱，无可救药的愚蠢，无法从错误中学习，所以成年人的责任是保护他们远离一切风险，代价却是儿童自我发展的内在自由。</p><p>温尼科特欣赏，甚至为那些会对父母尖叫、从他们钱包里偷钱的青春期少年辩护。他认为，<u>这些“问题行为”其实是一个孩子被好好爱过的证据。正因为被好好爱过，所以才敢于如此挑战成人世界</u>。</p><p><img

alt="《小欢喜》剧照"></p><p>他认为，这样的破坏对一个孩子来说有着重要的意义。如果父母无法容忍这种破坏，过早、过于严格地要求孩子的顺从，会导致一个“虚假自我”的出现——对<u>外顺从、表面上很好但却压抑了自己的重要本能、无法平衡社会性与破坏性，无法产生真正的慷慨或爱，因为它不曾被允许充分探索自私与恨</u>。</p><p>在他看来，那些没有创造性、沉闷枯槁的成年人，基本上都是在童年时期未曾被容许表现得像个真正的孩子，有孩子的一切黑暗情绪，包括嫉妒、贪婪、自私，但仍然被接纳、被爱。</p><p>至少在我的记忆里，18 岁以前的人生几乎完全是按照父母的意愿活着的。很少自由地选择什么，因此也不会对自己负责任。</p><p>我至今记得，第一次离开家乡来北京读大学，第一次独自面对世界时是多么的惶惑与不安。但正是在那种惶惑不安的自由中，我才开始慢慢学着按自己内心的声音去探索世界，学着以自己内心的感受作为行为的依据，知道自己想要什么，不想要什么，想要什么如何争取，不想要什么如何拒绝……</p><br><h1

年过去了，我们关于“好孩子”的模型有了多大的变化呢？</p><p>我们仍然对“成绩”有偏执，尽管越来越多的证据显示，就孩子的成长而言，个性的塑造远比认知更重要。</p><p>越来越多的父母意识到，顺从并不是一种好的品质。<u>顺从的孩子无法自己为自己思考，更容易受到同辈压力的影响，也容易成为有歹意的成年人的虐待</u>。</p><p>但从另一个角度来说，在“安全”的名义下，今天的父母对孩子日常生活的监控、规划与隔离比起过去有过之而无不及。</p><p>20 年前，如果一个妈妈每天送孩子去上学，会被当成神经病。但现在如果一个妈妈每天让孩子独自去上学，就会被老师和家长骂不负责任。</p><p>20 年前一个孩子成长过程中很多被认为是“正常”的性格或行为，比如发脾气、孤独、愤怒、害羞、内向，如今都被一一病理化为“心理问题”，如“多动症”“情绪障碍”等等。</p><p>心理咨询师徐卓在一篇我们的约稿中（《树欲静而风不止》）回忆自己的童年：“我生长于 70 年代的北京，小时候生长环境自由，也时不时的有些孩子气的冲突，‘基本上一三五收拾别人，二四六被别人收拾，周日休息’。<u>这些打打闹闹里面催生的‘人际技巧’或者‘冲突管理’能力，其实也是一种‘实践智慧’，譬如如何见机行事、怎样寻求帮助，何时需要暂避锋芒、何时应该虚张声势，对于成年之后进入社会有很大帮助。</u>”</p><p>其实，这一代的父母对于孩子安全的焦虑与恐惧并非毫无道理，但文明就是适应一个又一个不怎么完美的境况，人生就是一个接一个的难题。一个稚弱的孩子，如何长成一个健康、独立、有担当的成年人，不是通过清除 Ta 的成长过程中的一切障碍、挫折与痛苦，而是帮助他学会如何自己应对这些问题。</p><p>就像身体的免疫系统，你得暴露在病原体之中，否则你的身体不会知道如何应对病菌的攻击。从心理上来说也一样，<u>孩子需要暴露在适当的不适、失败与挣扎中，才能学会如何应对这些挫折，才能激发他们自我应对的“抗逆力”</u>。</p><p><img src=

alt="《少年的你》剧照"></p><p>几年前《大西洋月刊》上有一篇长文《如何让你的孩子长成一个心理病人》（How to Land Your Child in Therapy），作者是一位从业多年的心理咨询师，也是一位母亲。她在她的来访者中发现一个奇怪的群体，<u>他们明明有着十分幸福的童年，但成年后却觉得迷惘失落，有深深的空虚感</u>。</p><p>比如其中一位 20 多岁的女性，她的人生拥有一切令人羡慕的元素：父慈母爱，有亲密的兄弟姐妹，也有关系很好的朋友，受过良好教育，健康良好，有很好的工作和公寓。也没有任何抑郁或者焦虑的家族遗传基因，但是她的痛苦是真实的——夜夜失眠，害怕犯错，无法信任自己的直觉，总觉得自己做得不够好，有一种“漂泊无依”感。</p><p><u>最后，这位心理咨询师将病因指向父母的“过度保护”，对于子女“幸福”的偏执性追求，他们尽一切努力不让自己的孩子体验到哪怕一点点不适、焦虑或者失望</u>。当这些孩子长大之后，哪怕遭遇到人生中再正常不过的挫折与失望，也会有天塌下来的挫败感。</p><br><h1 id="木匠，还是园丁？"><a href="#木匠，还是园丁？" class="headerlink" title="木匠，还是园丁？"></a><p align="center">木匠，还是园丁？<p></h1><p>那么，我们到底应该怎样爱我们的孩子？多少的爱、什么样的爱才是恰当的？父母的爱与孩子的自由之间，父母的保护与孩子的自主性之间，应该是一种什么样的关系？</p><p>在《园丁与木匠》中，艾莉森·戈普尼克，美国加州大学伯克利分校的发展心理学教授给出了一个很好的答案。</p><p>她认为，过去半个多世纪以来，美国的主流媒体上呈现的亲子关系是一种典型的木匠思维。木匠是什么？<u>木匠是一种工作，是根据我的想法、我的品位、我的技术、我的蓝图，制造一张桌子、一把椅子，或者一个书架出来。无论你的成品是桌子、椅子、书架，它的优劣可以用来判断木匠的好坏</u>。</p><div class="img-wrap"><div class="img-bg"><img class="img" src= "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/posts/Education/image-20210815124401174.png" alt="《小欢喜》剧照" style="width:80%;"/></div><span class="image-caption">《小欢喜》剧照</span></div><p>主流媒体鼓吹的“育儿”（parenting）也一样——你有一个原材料，就是你的孩子，只要你足够努力，技术和专业过硬，你的作品就会是一个聪明、成功、幸福的大人。<u>所以，主流文化中亲子关系的图像其实就是木匠和桌子。当然，这个画面背后是亿万美元的市场</u>。</p><p>但在她的实验室里，最前沿的科学研究所呈现的亲子关系却是另外一幅图像——<u>是一个关于园丁照顾花园的画面</u>。</p><p>如果你是一个园丁，你就会知道，你可能在花园里忙了一天，汗流浃背，累得跟狗一样，就像那些一天下来觉得自己累得跟行尸走肉一样的父母，但那些花花草草没有一个地方是按你原来的心意长出来的。用中国人的话说，就是“有心栽花花不开，无心插柳柳成荫”。</p><p><strong>为什么会这样？</strong></p><p>这里面其实有很深刻的原因。因为园丁在种东西的时候，不是想着要种出最大的西红柿，或者最美的兰花，他创造的是一个生态系统，各种植物可以在里面共同生长，只要你保证土壤丰饶、空间安全，花花草草就能以各种你预料不到的方式自行应对环境的变化。就应对变化而言，花园远比西红柿大棚或者兰花温室要灵活得多。</p><div class="img-wrap"><div class="img-bg"><img class="img" src= "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/posts/Education/image-20210815124414778.png" alt="《西小河的夏天》剧照" style="width:80%;"/></div><span class="image-caption">《西小河的夏天》剧照</span></div><p>戈普尼克认为，<u>从进化生物学的角度来说，这就是人类童年的全部意义所在——创造和保护这种生态系统</u>，在这个生态系统里，各种新奇的、怪异的、有趣的、难以预测的变化可以发生，孩子可以自由探索应对的方法，等他们长大以后，每一代人能做上一代人预料不到的事情。</p><p>所以，为人父母，不是工作，不是木匠做桌子，重要的不是技巧。<u>为人父母，是园丁种花，其本质是爱。这种爱没有目标，没有蓝图，但它确实有一个目的。这个目的不是去改变我们爱的孩子，而是给予他们成长所需要的，一个安全、温暖、自由的环境，或者说，一个“花园”</u>。在这个花园里，一个生命层层绽放，最终 Ta 会找到属于自己的那条路（即使那条路不是我们会为自己选择，或者为他们选择的），Ta 会塑造自己的命运，Ta 会成为一个独一无二的自己。</p><br><h1 id="博主读后感"><a href="#博主读后感" class="headerlink" title="博主读后感"></a>博主读后感</h1><p>我呢，小时候算是亲戚眼中的那种“乖孩子”，<del>幼鹅园之前嘴巴倍儿甜喜欢到处喊人</del>，我不是一个喜欢惹事、闹事、犯事的人，小时候在别人家不哭也不闹，东西掉地上也会习惯性捡起来把它放好，也常常在意他人对我的感受与看法。在家里，我除了小孩子都有的调皮外，总体上比较听父母的话，整个童年仿佛成长在温室，温暖但不适。</p><p>长大以后，逐渐发现自己身上的一些缺点且难以改正，也越来越意识到家长在孩子成长教育上扮演着重要的角色。其实我小学时就开始关注教育方面的话题，目的可能有仨：一是想知道自己的父母在教育上存在的一些问题，二是吃一堑长一智，意识到坏毛病并纠正它，三是想知道自己未来做父母了该如何教育后代。</p><p>那些所谓的“好孩子们”可能常伴有内向、敏感、没主见、害怕责任、怕麻烦他人、牺牲自己完成他人却不懂得拒绝、遇到挫折选择退后的特点。所以孩子需要多暴露在适当的不适、失败与挣扎中，学会如何应对这些挫折，同时家长要给予一定的自由与信任，适当的关怀与包容，就像文章里说的做园丁式的家长，这样培育出来的孩子才具有一定的抗逆能力。</p><p>其实我觉得，“好孩子”有“好孩子”的优点，“坏孩子”也有“坏孩子”的优势，找到它们间的一个平衡点并控制好这个度，可能是我们新一代父母要为之努力的地方。（<del>等等，我还在上大学呢，怎么就#%￥*</del>）</p>]]></content>

content=&quot;no-referrer&quot; /&gt;</code>即可</p><p><strong>原理分析</strong>：</p><p>http 请求体的 header 中有一个 referrer 字段，用来表示发起 http 请求的源地址信息，这个 referrer 信息是可以省略但是不可修改的，就是说你只能设置是否带上这个 referrer 信息，不能定制 referrer 里面的值。</p><p>服务器端在拿到这个 referrer 值后就可以进行相关的处理，比如图片资源，可以通过 referrer 值判断请求是否来自本站，若不是则返回 403 或者重定向返回其他信息，从而实现图片的防盗链。上面出现 403 就是因为，请求的是别人服务器上的资源，但把自己的 referrer 信息带过去了，被对方服务器拦截返回了 403。</p><p>在前端可以通过 meta 来设置 referrer policy(来源策略)，具体可以设置哪些值以及对应的结果参考<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy">这里</a>。所以针对上面的 403 情况的解决方法，就是把 referrer 设置成<code>no-referrer</code>，这样发送请求不会带上 referrer 信息，对方服务器也就无法拦截了。</p><p>浏览器中 referrer 默认的值是<code>no-referrer-when-downgrade</code>，就是除了降级请求的情况以外都会带上 referrer 信息。降级请求是指 https 协议的地址去请求 http 协议，所以上面 403 的情况还有另一种解决方法就是，请求的图片地址换成 http 协议，自己的地址使用 http 协议，这样降级请求也不会带上 referrer。</p><br><h1 id="技巧合集"><a href="#技巧合集" class="headerlink" title="技巧合集"></a>技巧合集</h1><h2 id="将页脚-Footer-固定在网页底部"><a

入门+数据分析</a>视频</p></blockquote><h1 id="初识网络爬虫"><a href="#初识网络爬虫" class="headerlink" title="初识网络爬虫"></a>初识网络爬虫</h1><p><strong>网络爬虫</strong>（又被称为网页蜘蛛、网络机器人），是一种按照一定的规则，自动地抓取互联网信息的程序或者脚本。</p><p>其<strong>本质</strong>是，由一个入口网页进行深入，不停的进行其他的 URL 的爬取，然后再把抓取到的网页进行分析处理得出想要的数据。</p><p><strong>Robots 协议</strong>，是网站跟爬虫间的协议，用简单直接的 txt 格式文本方式告诉对应的爬虫被允许的权限</p><h2 id="网络爬虫的一般流程"><a href="#网络爬虫的一般流程" class="headerlink" title="网络爬虫的一般流程"></a>网络爬虫的一般流程</h2><ol><li><p><strong>发起请求，获取响应</strong></p><p>通过 http 库，对目标站点进行请求。等同于自己打开浏览器，输入网址</p><p>常用库：urllib、urllib3、requests</p><p>服务器会返回请求的内容，一般为：html、二进制文件（视频，音频）、文档，json 字符串</p></li><li><p><strong>解析内容</strong></p><p>寻找自己需要的信息，就是利用正则表达式或者其他库提取目标信息</p><p>常用库：re、beautifulsoup4</p></li><li><p><strong>数据持久化</strong><br>将解析得到的数据保存到文件或者数据库中</p></li></ol><br><h1 id="基本流程"><a

class="headerlink" title="分析页面"></a>分析页面</h3><p>借助 Chrome 开发者工具（F12）来分析网页，在 Elements 下找到需要的数据位置</p><h3 id="编码规范"><a href="#编码规范" class="headerlink" title="编码规范"></a>编码规范</h3><ul><li>一般 Python 程序第一行需要加入：<code>#-*- coding:utf-8 -*-</code>或者<code># coding=utf-8</code>。这样可以在代码中包含中文</li><li>使用函数实现单一功能或相关联功能的代码段，可以提高可读性和代码重复利用率，函数代码块以 def 关键词开头。</li><li>可以加入 main 函数用于测试程序：<code>if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:</code></li><li>使用 # 添加注释，说明代码段的作用</li></ul><h3 id="引入模块"><a href="#引入模块" class="headerlink" title="引入模块"></a>引入模块</h3><p><strong>模块 module</strong>：用来从逻辑上组织 Python 代码（变量、函数、类），本质就是 py 文件，提高代码的可维护性。</p><p>module 可看作一个工具类，可共用或者隐藏代码细节，将相关代码放置在一个 module 以便让代码更好用、易懂，让 coder 重点放在高层逻辑上。</p><p>module 能定义函数、类、变量，也能包含可执行的代码。module 来源有 3 种：</p><ol><li><p>Python 内置的模块（标准库）</p></li><li><p>第三方模块</p></li><li><p>自定义模块</p></li></ol><p><strong>包 package</strong>： 为避免模块名冲突，Python 引入了按目录组织模块的方法。包是含有 Python 模块的文件夹。</p><p>例子：</p><figure class="highlight

title="什么是机器学习"></a>什么是机器学习</h3><p>我们可以将<strong>模型</strong>理解为一个函数，输入模型的数据，我们称为<strong>训练数据</strong>。由训练数据来确定函数的参数的过程就叫<strong>训练数据</strong>（其实就是解方程）。</p><p>通过不断训练，我们最终会得到一个合适的模型，从而可以对未知的数据先进行<u>预测</u>。其实这过程和咋们人类学习过程十分类似，只不人的认知与判断是通过经验得到，而机器是通过<u>数据</u>得到。</p><p>其中，用于训练模型得到的每条数据，我们成为一个<strong>样本</strong>，而样本中的每个属性，我们称为<strong>特征</strong>，每个样本的<u>目标输出值</u>，我们称为<strong>标签</strong>（监督学习），我们习惯使用 x 来表示特征，习惯使用 y 来表示标签。</p><p>其实，咋们在初中就会训练模型了，比如算一道已知两点求直线方程的数学题，这类题目已经包括了机器学习的 2 个重要步骤：</p><ol><li>训练</li><li>预测</li></ol><p>正如大家所感受的那样，机器学习就是<u>一个类似解方程</u>的过程。然而，现实中的数据不可能像求直线方程那么简单，模型也不可能总是通过肉眼能观察出来，这时就需要咋们通过<strong>机器学习算法</strong>来进行建模了。</p><h3 id="机器学习应用场景"><a href="#机器学习应用场景"

Apollo）</li><li>专家系统（AlphaGo）</li><li>推荐系统（电商）</li><li>搜索引擎（利用历史点击数据把用户经常点击的结果排在前面）</li><li>各种预测系统（天气预测，足球预测）</li></ol><h3 id="机器学习与人工智能"><a href="#机器学习与人工智能" class="headerlink" title="机器学习与人工智能"></a>机器学习与人工智能</h3><p><strong>人工智能（Artificial Intelligence, AI）</strong>是计算机科学的一个分支，目的是让计算机能够像人一样，对外界环境做出反应</p><p><strong>机器学习（Machine Learning, ML）</strong>，正是实现人工智能的一种方式。</p><p><strong>深度学习（Deep Learning, DL）</strong>是一种机器学习技术，基于神经网络，适用于处理音频、视频、语言理解等方面。</p><h3 id="机器学习分类"><a href="#机器学习分类" class="headerlink" title="机器学习分类"></a>机器学习分类</h3><p>机器学习的问题分为监督学习和非监督学习两大类：</p><ul><li><p><strong>监督学习</strong>（ supervised learning ）：学习样本中有标签，好比有老师告诉你正确答案</p><ul><li><strong>分类</strong>（classification）输出为有限的离散型变量，比如预测明天的天气类型： 晴天</li><li><strong>回归</strong>（regression）输出为连续型变量，比如预测明天的温度： 8-25°C</li></ul><p>常用的监督学习算法 ：线性回归 、逻辑回归 、决策树 和 SVM（支持向量机）</p></li><li><p><strong>无监督学习</strong>（unsupervised learning）：学习样本中无标签，靠机器观察自学，自己找模式和特征</p><ul><li><p><strong>聚类</strong>（clustering）</p></li><li><p><strong>降维</strong>（dimensionality reduction）</p><p>常用非监督学习算法：K means、DBScan、PCA</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="机器学习流程"><a href="#机器学习流程" class="headerlink" title="机器学习流程"></a>机器学习流程</h3><p><img src=

alt=""></p><p><strong>数据预处理</strong>：</p><p>数据集成：合并来自不同数据源的数据、处理冗余数据</p><p>数据清洗：缺失值、异常值</p><p><strong>特征工程</strong>：</p><p>特征选择：通过各种统计和模型评分等筛选出合适的</p><p>特征特征变换：将类别型特征转换为数值型特征</p><p>特征组合：结合业务数据，两两组合一阶离散特征形成高阶组合特征</p><p>特征降维：PCA、LDA 等算法减少特征个数</p><p>特征归一化：消除数据特征之间的量纲影响，把特征值转变控制在 [0,1] 的区间</p><p><strong>数据建模</strong>：</p><p>选择模型 → 训练模型 ↔ 评估模型 → 部署模型</p><p><strong>处理类型型特征常用编码方式</strong>：</p><ul><li><strong>序号编码</strong>（Ordinal Encoding）<br>通常用于处理类别间具有大小关系的数据。比如学历分为了专科、本科、硕士三档，那么<br>用 3 表示<br>硕士、 2 表示 本科、 1 表示 专科，转换后依然保留了大小关系。</li><li><strong>独热编码</strong>（One hot Encoding，用得较多）<br>通常用于处理类别间不具有大小关系的特征。比如血型，一共有 4 个取值（ A、B、AB、O ），独热<br>编码会把血型变成一个 4 维稀疏向量， A 型血 →（1, 0, 0, 0），B 型血 →（0, 1, 0, 0），AB<br>型血 → （0, 0, 1, 0），O 型血 →（0, 0, 0, 1）</li></ul><p><strong>模型评估</strong>：</p><ul><li><p><strong>留出法</strong>（Holdout）</p><p>它将原始的样本集划分为训练集和测试集两部分：比如 70% 用于模型训练， 30% 用于模型评估测试。缺点就是评估效果与原始分组有关系。为了消除随机性，就引入了“交叉检验”的思想</p></li><li><p><strong>交叉检验</strong>（Cross Validation）</p><ul><li><strong>𝑘 折交叉验证</strong>（𝑘 𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑑）：首先将全部样本划分为 𝑘 个大小相等的样本子集；依次遍历这 𝑘 个子集，每次把当前自己作为验证集，其余所有子集作为训练集；最后 把 𝑘 次 评估指标的平均值作为最终评估指标， k 经常取 10 。</li><li><strong>留一验证</strong>（ 𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑣𝑒 𝑜𝑛𝑒 𝑜𝑢𝑡）：每次留下一个样本作为验证集，其它所有样本作为训练集。如果有 𝑘 个样本，则需要训练 𝑘 次，测试 𝑘

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>咋们平时学习英语过程中，总能遇到些既熟悉又陌生的一组近义词，又不晓得有撒子区别， So let&#39;s get started, friends!</p></blockquote><h1 id="n"><a href="#n" class="headerlink" title="n."></a>n.</h1><h2 id="work-amp-job"><a href="#work-amp-job" class="headerlink" title="work &amp; job"></a>work &amp; job</h2><ol><li><p>job 是可数名词，强调职业。work 是不可数名词，强调抽象的工作，如日常工作学习。work 这个词比 job 更普遍，job 是一种特定的职业，work 是指为实现目标而进行的努力和活动，work 既可以在正式工作中也可以在工作之外完成。</p><ul><li><p>He got a new job. 他找到了一份新工作。</p></li><li><p>He got some work to do. 他有一些工作要做。</p></li></ul></li><li><p>work 多指体力或脑力的努力或活动。job 多指为换取报酬而进行的日常活动。</p></li></ol><p>参考文章：<a href="http://www.chusan.com/zhongkao/92960.html">work 和 job 的区别</a></p><h2 id="holiday-amp-vacation"><a href="#holiday-amp-vacation" class="headerlink" title="holiday &amp; vacation"></a>holiday &amp; vacation</h2><p>其实可以混用，没有对错之分，大家都能理解，也不会闹笑话。</p><p>如果要区分的话，Holiday 通常指一些官方的、特定的、宗教性质的或国家性质的假期，比如圣诞节、复活节、国庆节等。</p><p>在英式英语中，&quot;holiday&quot; 也可以用来指度假。</p><p>e.g. Happy holidays!</p><p>Vacation 则更多指的是个人或家庭在某段时间内离开家庭或工作环境度假的时间。</p><p>在美式英语中，&quot;vacation&quot; 通常用来指员工在公司获得的带薪假期，而英式英语中则称之为&quot;annual leave&quot;。</p><p>e.g. Summer vacation.</p><h1 id="v"><a href="#v" class="headerlink" title="v."></a>v.</h1><h2 id="study-amp-learn"><a href="#study-amp-learn" class="headerlink" title="study &amp; learn"></a>study &amp; learn</h2><p>learn 倾向于指学习一门技能或一种技巧，它强调获得知识的结果, 偏向于&quot;学会&quot;的意思。除了学习, 还有&quot;得知, 了解到&quot;的意思。learn是<strong>瞬间动词</strong>，后面往往跟的是<u>时间点</u>。</p><p>study 倾向于指课堂上能学习到的知识，它强调学习知识的过程, 偏向于&quot;学习&quot;的意思。除了学习, 还有&quot;研究&quot;的意思。study是<strong>延续性动词</strong>，后面一般跟的是<u>时间段</u>。</p><p>e.g. I studied but I didn&#39;t learn anything.</p><p>e.g. I learned to play the guitar when I was 18.</p><p>e.g. I&#39;ve been studying English for fifteen years.</p><p>参考文章：<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5OTM1MzE2MA==&mid=2448382276&idx=1&sn=7e347e371c056e54ca3f05ff4ff65cad&chksm=b32737638450be75406e02f58f809bc8c46a757d20d7c476c5539a53fe6b0bed2303b1936b64&scene=132#wechat_redirect">你是在“study English”还是在“learn English”呢？区别看这里~！</a></p><h2 id="reserve-amp-preserve"><a href="#reserve-amp-preserve" class="headerlink" title="reserve &amp;

title="词伙的介绍"></a>词伙的介绍</h2><h3 id="什么是词伙？"><a href="#什么是词伙？" class="headerlink" title="什么是词伙？"></a>什么是词伙？</h3><p>词伙（collocations）无论是在<strong>写作</strong>还是<strong>口语</strong>中都很重要，剑桥雅思公布的官方评分标准明确指明考生需要展示词伙能力。词伙可以理解成咋们常说的“搭配”、“短语”，但与之不同的是，它有仨特点：</p><ol><li>与话题相关</li><li>不只是 2 个单词，可以由多个组成</li><li>需注意单复数、句子的位置和其它使用的特点</li></ol><h3 id="词伙的重要性"><a href="#词伙的重要性" class="headerlink" title="词伙的重要性"></a>词伙的重要性</h3><ol><li><p><strong>辨析单词</strong></p><p>通过记背词伙能更好理解单词。煮个栗子，electric 和 electrical，仅通过看单词长相或背释义很难去分清它们的区别，但通过记背词伙，electric cars（电动汽车），electrical equipment（电器），能更好去理解单词意思，还有 influence，impact，effect 等意思相近的词。其实我觉得非母语者学英语的方式完全可以和像母语者那样，你无需知道太多的规则，你用多了见多了自然就形成一种天然的语感，知道怎么使用怎么搭配就行。</p></li><li><p><strong>减少中式英文表达</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>使表达更加简洁</strong></p><p>咋们很多人在表达一件事时，都习惯于逐字翻译自己大脑中预设好的中文，这样很容易造成中式英文的产生和句子的冗长，相反你每次表达事物时，应该首先问自己有没有合适的词伙来表达这个 idea，这时，<del>词伙的 privilege 已尽数体现</del>。</p></li></ol><blockquote><p>你们还在疯狂背单词吗？每天定时打卡？到最后单词记住了吗？会灵活使用它吗？是时候花点时间背背词伙了 hh，无论是小初高英语，还是大学雅思托福，都会起到很大的作用。（<del>感觉我写个笔记，像打广告似的</del>）</p></blockquote><h3

      <title>终于有人把内卷讲明白了</title>
      <link href="/posts/49f4d334/"/>
      <url>/posts/49f4d334/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>本文为转载内容，来自微信公众号<code>CSDN企业招聘</code></p><p>原文地址：<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/luPHXaU3CcytHyonCZbSog">终于有人把内卷讲明白了</a></p><p><a href="/cc">版权协议</a></p></blockquote><br><h1 id="小镇的故事"><a href="#小镇的故事" class="headerlink" title="小镇的故事"></a><p align="center">小镇的故事<p></h1><h2 id="什么是内卷"><a href="#什么是内卷" class="headerlink" title="什么是内卷"></a>什么是内卷</h2><p>很久很久以前，地球上有一个小镇。小镇上有很多鞋店，这些鞋店每天上午 10 点开门，中午 12 点到下午 2 点午休，下午 2 点到晚上 6 点继续营业；每周一至周五营业 5 天，周末休息。</p><p>夏天最热的那几天，鞋店老板们会纷纷把店关掉，去南方的海边度假；冬天最冷的那几天，鞋店老板们也会纷纷把店关掉，去北方的山里滑雪。</p><p>多年以来，小镇上的常住人口没有什么变化，鞋的品质一直优秀，供货也稳定，所以，<strong>小镇上的鞋的供需关系一直处于一个近乎完美的平衡状态。</strong></p><p>后来有一天，一户人家出于不明原因从大城市搬来小镇上，并且也开了一家鞋店。小镇虽然小，但也算具有一定规模，鞋的供需平衡还不至于因为新增一家鞋店而被打破。</p><p>但是，那座大城市的人民以勤奋、能吃苦著称。果然，这户来自大城市的人家也具备这些特点。他们家的鞋店每天早晨 7 点就开门了，中午也不午休，晚上直到 11 点才关门；周末他们也正常营业，夏天和冬天他们也从不去度假。</p><p>渐渐地，他们的“勤奋”得到了回报，他们鞋店的生意明显好于小镇上的其他鞋店。以前小镇人民吃完晚饭后是无法买鞋的，但现在，他们几乎随时可以去大城市人的鞋店买鞋，也就没什么必要光顾其他鞋店了。</p><p>但小镇老板们也不服输，他们纷纷效仿大城市人民的作息时间，每周工作 7 天，每天工作 16 小时。他们的“勤奋”也得到了“回报”：他们的营业收入恢复到了以前的状态。</p><p>那么，此时的小生活发生了什么样的变化呢？由于小镇人口并没有增加，鞋的需求量保持恒定，跟以前一样，所以每家鞋店最终的营业收入没什么变化，并不会增长。但营业时间从原来的每周 5 天，每天 6 小时变成了每周 7 天，每天 16 小时。</p><p>也就是说，<strong>他们的工作时间变长了，但收入却没有增加。</strong></p><p>这就是传说中的内卷（involution）。同时，这也是传说中的囚徒困境。</p><h2 id="什么是囚徒困境"><a href="#什么是囚徒困境" class="headerlink" title="什么是囚徒困境"></a>什么是囚徒困境</h2><p>我们可以把鞋店简化为两家：大城市鞋店和小镇鞋店。他们工作模式也可简化为 996 和 955。小镇上鞋的需求不变。根据以上条件可知：</p><ul><li><strong>如果两家鞋店都选择 955</strong>，会平分市场需求，同时也保证了休息时间，这种情况下总体收益最高，假设两家的收益分别是 5, 5。</li><li><strong>如果两家鞋店都采取 996</strong>工作模式，最终仍然会平分市场，但由于休息时间减少，幸福感降低，收益不能再是 5, 5 而应该是 3, 3。</li><li><strong>而如果一家店选择了 996 而另一家店选择了 955</strong>，那么 996 鞋店最终可能会独占市场，而 955 鞋店会没生意，于是两家的收益可假设为 8, 0。</li></ul><p>这场博弈中两位鞋店的<strong>赢利表</strong>如下：</p><table><thead><tr><th>大城市鞋垫 / 小镇鞋垫</th><th>955</th><th>996</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>955</strong></td><td>5，5</td><td>0，8</td></tr><tr><td><strong>996</strong></td><td>8，0</td><td>3，3</td></tr></tbody></table><p>两位鞋店老板彼此不知道对方是怎么想的，但他们都是“聪明”人，很容易算出：如果对方 996，那么我 955 的收益是 0，我也 996 的收益是 3，所以我应该 996；如果对方 955，那么我也 955 的收益是 5，我 996 的收益 8，所以我应该 996。</p><p>最终，两家鞋店都选择了 996，这场博弈达到<strong>纳什均衡</strong>，<strong>两位老板都成了 996 的“囚徒”。</strong></p><div class="note green no-icon flat"><p>纳什均衡是这样一种状态，在该状态下每个参与人所采取的策略都是对于其他参与人的策略的最优反应。</p><p>——摘自董志强 《身边的博弈》，机械工业出版社·华章经管</p></div><h2 id="什么是勤劳和公平"><a href="#什么是勤劳和公平" class="headerlink" title="什么是勤劳和公平"></a>什么是勤劳和公平</h2><p>任何一个行业都不是孤立存在的。鞋店老板们工作时间变长了，娱乐时间就变少了，他们光顾餐馆、咖啡馆的次数就少了，于是小镇上的餐饮业变得冷清了。虽然鞋店的营业时间延长，他们的耗电量增加，但餐馆、咖啡馆却在一些生意冷清的时段进入了节电模式，所以发电厂的生意也没有变好。</p><p><strong>总体算下来，小镇的经济不但没有变好，反而变差了一些。</strong>所以，我们可以看到，<strong>内卷不但有危害，而且会危害到看似无辜的每一个人。</strong></p><p>疲惫的小镇鞋店老板们也很快意识到了这个问题，于是他们成立鞋业协会，联合小镇政府制定强制性的行业规则和劳动法：每日工作时间不得超过 8 小时、每周营业时间不得超过 5 天，法定节假日必须休息……鞋业协会有权要求不遵守规定的鞋店关门，对屡教不改者，鞋业协会将联合小镇政府将其驱逐出小镇……</p><p>行规一出，来自大城市的人家就立即抗议，他们觉得这是对勤劳致富者的不尊重，也是对消费者的不尊重，这是干涉他们的自由，这是对他们的不公平对待和地域歧视……</p><p>鞋业协会立即怼了回去：你们所谓的勤劳并没有真正致富，反而对社会造成了危害。鞋店又不是急救中心，消费者早一天买鞋还是晚一天买鞋往往并没有区别。你们只顾着自己的作息时间而不管他人，这不是自由，而是自私，这才是真正的不公平……劳动法面前人人平等，并没针对谁、歧视谁，对违法的人采取强制措施也是天经地义……</p><br><h1 id="大城市的故事"><a href="#大城市的故事" class="headerlink" title="大城市的故事"></a><p align="center">大城市的故事<p></h1><p>如果你觉得内卷是老板们才要关心的问题，跟打工人无关，那么我们离开小镇，来看看大城市里发生的故事。</p><p>大城市里有一家皮鞋款式设计公司，原本每一位打工人都是 9 点上班 5 点下班。后来，一位从小镇来的打工人进入这家公司，他本没有从业经验，为了得到这份工作在简历上和面试时都说了谎。于是开始打工时，他非常吃力，每天 5 点下班时他都无法完成工作，只好继续加班到 9 点才离开。</p><p>有一天，老板买了一个跑步机放在自己办公室里。从那天起，老板都会在完成工作后跑步健身，要在 8 点左右才离开办公室。所以他发现，这位小镇青年每天在 8 点时还没下班。于是，在下一个月的公司例会上，他表扬了小镇青年的刻苦精神，并宣布要他发奖金。</p><p>此后，其他打工人也发生了变化。有些人想，反正我下班之后也没什么事情，不如等 8 点以后再走，让老板也看到我加班，也给我发奖金。于是，加班的人逐渐多了起来。</p><p>起初，他们获得奖金，但一段时间过后，<strong>随着加班的人变成了大多数</strong>，老板对这些“勤奋刻苦”的人见怪不怪了，<strong>奖金的事也不再提了</strong>。反而是那些下班后有事要做不能加班的人经常被老板批评，甚至被扣工资。</p><p>于是，打工人的工作时间延长了，但收入并没有增加，内卷害了每一个人。</p><p>要打破囚徒困境，打工人可以像小镇鞋店老板那样，成立工会争取自己合法权利。但他们其实还有另一种办法，就是辞掉这份工作，去另一家不需要加班的公司。</p><p>而对于老板来说，如果选择满足工会要求，其实并没有什么损失，大家只是回到以前的状态而已，公司的业绩就算不增长，也不会下降。但如果他选择拒绝，那么那些本来能力优秀的打工人很可能选择离开，留下像小镇青年那样不得不加班的低效率打工人，这就是<strong>劣币驱逐良币</strong>，毫无疑问，良币被驱逐意味着企业将蒙受损失。</p><br><h1 id="小结"><a href="#小结" class="headerlink" title="小结"></a><p align="center">小结<p></h1><p>因此，内卷不会创造价值，而且会危害每一个人。如果打工人不觉醒、不抗争，管理者不制定有效措施防止内卷，而任由内卷的发生，我们每一个人都将是受害者，每个人的幸福感都会降低。</p><br><h1 id="博主读后感"><a href="#博主读后感" class="headerlink" title="博主读后感"></a>博主读后感</h1><p>做好每个人自己的那一部分，仰望天空的同时也要脚踏实地，凡事要有自己的节奏，不盲目跟风加入内卷。知识从来都不是在匆匆忙忙中产生的，唯有静下心来，平衡好工作、学习与生活的关系，全民幸福指数才会提升。</p>]]></content>

      <title>对大数据智能推送和身份信息泄露的拙见</title>
      <link href="/posts/20afffc2/"/>
      <url>/posts/20afffc2/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>我发现很多人对<strong>大数据智能推送</strong>和<strong>身份信息泄露</strong>这俩事存在着<u>误解</u>，有些网友推荐视频看得老爽了，但看完了还是不忘评论一句：“这奇怪的大数据”，借此以我计算机小白的身份来聊一下这个话题。</p><p>先说说<strong>大数据智能推送</strong>，我对智能推送更多地呈中立态度，首先我觉得它这么一个设定本是以服务大众为主要目的，毕竟它能给你“投其所好的关怀”，有人可能会说：“它就是资本主义为了恰烂钱，想让你多使用它的 APP”，这问题仁者见仁智者见智，和半杯水问题一样。话说回来，若满屏幕都是你不感兴趣的内容你会有使用这个 APP 的欲望吗？若你不喜欢智能推送为什么还继续将 APP 放在手机中“<del>端起碗吃肉，放下筷子骂娘</del>”呢？退一步讲，智能推送<strong>是可以关闭的</strong>，至少我在哔哩哔哩 APP 中找到了关闭智能推送的设置，其它 APP 可以自行按需摸索。打个贴近于生活的比方，智能推送其实相当于你在你家楼下早点铺吃早饭时，阿姨问你：“今天还是 XX 面？还是不要辣吧？今天咋们这有新做的 XX 小吃，要不尝尝看？”，挺不起眼的一个生活问句，却让人感受到了重视与关怀，当然有些人还是会说：“她就是想让你每天来，好赚钱”，你细品我不评价。当然你不习惯阿姨这么问，可以用合适的话语告知让她下次不要再问了，或者索性换一家早点铺。有些人可能会吐槽，智能推送还会使人沉迷其中无法自拔，吞噬掉大量时间，说到底与其怪 APP 不如反思自己的时间管理和抗诱惑能力是不是存在着问题，它本是一个为了提升用户体验的一个设定，何况大多数人还是处于<del>白嫖</del>免费使用状态，希望多些理解包容，多从自身找原因。</p><p>当然了，<strong>APP 智能推送真的智能吗？</strong>我觉得目前还有些<strong>改进之处</strong>，比如有时候你只是好奇点进去看一下，APP 就默认你喜欢，于是海量相似内容席卷而来，所以在智能推送的算法上还得继续优化，比如提高智能推送触发门槛，即用户点了 n 次相似内容后，再来进行推送，这样是不是更人性化一点？当然每个人对一件事物的感兴趣程度也不能完全靠点击次数来推断，所以算法的优化之路道阻且长。再者，很多人提到智能推送会将人限定在一个框架中，限制获取外部信息的范围，缺乏自主思考能力，这点我非常认可，所以我认为推送一部分感兴趣的内容同时再推送一部分随机内容比较好，至于智能推送和随机推送的占比是多少，开发人员可以进行数据调查，得出一个用户普遍能接受的一个比例，或者将选择权交给用户，让我们自定义设置比例。当然了，相关设置的摆放位置还得明显化，使其 accessible ，即易被广大用户方便找到，而不是地毯式、抓瞎式去找设置，费时费力，容易劝退大批用户。</p><p>第二我想谈谈<strong>身份信息泄露</strong>这一件事，至于某些 APP 是否真的泄露了身份信息我不清楚，也没有任何明证，但很多人还是存在着一点误解，认为给自己发提醒短信、广告邮件一定是身份信息泄露。想象一个场景，你注册账号时需要填写手机号或者电子邮箱吧，而且在点击注册按钮之前会让你勾选<code>你已阅读用户协议、隐私政策</code>框，当然是否阅读是你的事情（顺便说句，我希望相关协议可以写的更直白易懂，少些官方套话、专业术语，否则我们会沦为点击“已阅”按钮的无情机器）。话说回来，你注册之后，APP 方可能会偶尔给你发些提醒短信或广告邮件，其实是件正常范围内的事情，<strong>不属于信息泄露</strong>，好比你家附近新开了家健身房并且可免费体验一次，在体验之前会进行简单的信息登记，之后健身房工作人员再给你打电话推销之类的操作就不算是信息泄露，毕竟你已经填写了电话号码，默认你允许健身房可以通过电话号码联系到你，谈何泄露呢？相反，如果是陌生平台给你发短信发邮件那才是真的信息泄露、甚至是诈骗。你要是觉着短信提醒、邮件推送影响到你的日常生活，是可以找到设置并取消掉，若没有相关设置，可以反馈投诉或者删除 APP、注销账号。最后提醒一句，在现实生活中呢，还是要多注意，不要在不明来源网站填写自己身份信息、账号密码，凡事三思而后行。</p><p>希望能理性看待 APP 推送和身份信息泄露这俩事儿吧，消除误解，不跟风下结论，勿让自己的大脑成为别人思想的跑马场，同时也要保护好自己的个人隐私。Peace &amp; Love！</p><blockquote><p>欢迎友善地各抒己见</p></blockquote>]]></content>

      <title>和声那些事</title>
      <link href="/posts/664d97f5/"/>
      <url>/posts/664d97f5/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>前言</strong>：</p><p>唱歌是我的爱好之一，玩了这么多年全民 K 歌，有点 fed up with it，突然想玩玩和声 try some new shit，于是就开始了对爱好皮毛的探索旅程。（<a href="https://blog.harriswong.top/posts/60ae04a4/">原谅我习惯双语混杂表达</a>）</p></blockquote><h2 id="什么是和声？"><a href="#什么是和声？" class="headerlink" title="什么是和声？"></a>什么是和声？</h2><p>通常是指某一调性内的和弦结构及和弦之间的连接方式。你可以广义地理解为伴奏里那小小的人声，通常和主声交织在一起。和声可以在纵向上和横向上丰富音乐，让音乐听起来更丰满、更立体，好的和声进行能让一首歌曲变得更加好听。</p><h2 id="和声编配"><a href="#和声编配" class="headerlink" title="和声编配"></a>和声编配</h2><ol><li><p>包括<strong>同度</strong>（适合不同音色的俩人）、<strong>三度</strong>、<strong>四度</strong>、<strong>五度</strong>、<strong>八度</strong>。一首歌里尽量不要全部采用三度或四度的和声编配，这样会显得特别单调，同时也要保证每轨单独播放也是好听的。我个人喜欢往上或往下叠唱三度，这也最常见的和声方式。</p><blockquote><p>我发现和声和钢琴的和弦构造有异曲同工之妙，对钢琴有了解的友友们可能会有这种感 jio。</p></blockquote></li><li><p><strong>Freestyle</strong>。你可以凭借乐感和一定的理论知识去设计和声，通过 Freestyle 来找灵感，挑出比较和谐、悦耳的那种和声设计。</p></li></ol><div class="note warning no-icon flat"><p><strong>注意</strong>：<strong>不要全曲都有和声</strong>。偶尔的和声有画龙点睛的效果，一首歌的层次感很重要，全程高能会使人感到听觉疲惫。</p></div><h2 id="和声该如何演唱？"><a href="#和声该如何演唱？" class="headerlink" title="和声该如何演唱？"></a>和声该如何演唱？</h2><p>从和声的<strong>咬字</strong>角度，得依据<strong>风格</strong>来定，像 R&amp;B 风格的和声就通常很丰富，和声和主声基本是同等地位，所以作曲时，和声和主声可以一样的 <del>骚</del> 飘，各种转音玩起来，但其他风格，和声地位通常低于主声，以达到衬托主声作用，此时和声的咬字可以相应柔和些。</p><p>从<strong>气息</strong>角度，和声的<strong>气声居多</strong>，唱的时候同时加点气声，音色不会那么干，可以营造整首歌的氛围感。</p><p>从<strong>录音</strong>角度，录和声时距离麦克风最好比录主声要远一些，距离产生美。</p><h3 id="常见的和声方法"><a href="#常见的和声方法" class="headerlink" title="常见的和声方法"></a>常见的和声方法</h3><ol><li><p><strong>叠唱</strong></p><p>可以在和弦的组成音里面找到可以跟主旋律构成相对和谐音程的音，然后再试着让自己的和声变得富有旋律性。更为高级一点的做法是你还可以使用一些比较不和谐，听起来“怪怪”的音程，制造听觉上的一些冲突，然后去把它解决掉，让音乐更富张力。</p></li><li><p><strong>Call and Response 形式的使用</strong></p><p>Call and Response 的形式源自于黑人音乐，可以理解为中国民俗对山歌的“一呼一应”。举个栗子，比如 EXO 的《十二月的奇迹》2 分 58 秒处的“你改变了一切，我整个生命，这一切，我整个世界”，就是非常典型的 Call and response 的手法，这一段因为有和声的衬托带来的情感宣泄，使这首歌到达了一定的高潮。其实你平时仔细听歌，你会发现很多歌都有这样的设计。</p></li><li><p><strong>男女齐唱</strong></p><p>当男女生一起齐唱同一个旋律的时候，会有一种天然的和声感，这是因为男生女生本身音色不同，女声偏清脆悦耳，男声偏低沉浑厚，然后在演唱同一段旋律的时候也会有天然的八度差，就会有一种平行的空间感和层次感。</p><blockquote><p>我不想再用全民 K 歌和自己合唱，怎么办？<del>在线蹲一名 🙋‍♀️ 选手</del></p></blockquote></li></ol><h3 id="参考资料："><a href="#参考资料：" class="headerlink" title="参考资料："></a>参考资料：</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/370764530">好听的和声应该怎么编配，又如何演唱呢？</a></li><li><a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/284541292/answer/527287763">和声到底是啥？</a></li><li><a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/40415441/answer/729729372">和声具体的编法？</a></li></ul><br><blockquote><p><strong>结束语</strong>：</p><p>单单靠文字只能算是对和声的基本了解，重要的是多听多唱多练，平时听歌时多留意这首歌的和声是如何编配的，从已有作品中吸收经验，并付诸于实践。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

主题博客来说，该主题有标志性的侧边栏，如果归档页只显示默认 10 篇文章的话，那么多出来一长条的侧边栏会显得非常丑和多余。</p><p>综上两点，设置归档页文章显示数再多于首页，非常有必要！</p>              </div>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>超长前言</strong>：</p><p>友友们看了那么多教程或许已经有了自己 DIY 的想法，开始对其他博主美化魔改教程有了自己的认知和理解，或者想按照自己的审美来改，但却又无从下手，没有思绪，本篇就给博客新人们分享下<u>经验思路</u>，涨涨姿势，<del>早日脱离美化魔改的苦海</del>。（本篇仅针对<strong>Butterfly 主题</strong>，其它主题的友友们仅供参考噢）</p><p>美化魔改虽说比较费时费力，但能看到最终效果还是能令人开心一整天。但过度沉迷于美化魔改之中，有些违背搭建博客的初衷，其实博客是用来分享、记录知识的一个载体，在美化魔改上所花的时间应远少于在文章上的。可是不经历乘风破浪怎能返璞归真？传统功夫点到为止，咋们开始吧！</p></blockquote><h2 id="美化魔改是什么？"><a href="#美化魔改是什么？" class="headerlink" title="美化魔改是什么？"></a>美化魔改是什么？</h2><p><strong>美化</strong>指的是使博客外观更加好看，一般是对 css、styl 样式文件的更改。</p><p><strong>魔改</strong>指的是对博客源码的更改，通常会更改布局框架的结构，其中我认为魔改包含了美化。</p><p><strong>两者的区别</strong>：美化通常不用改源码，只需更改自定义插入的样式代码，而魔改则需要更改源码。</p><blockquote><p>魔改的缺点是主题升级后，魔改的地方都会被更新后的代码给覆盖，重新魔改一遍很麻烦，所以我建议升级的时候可以按照 GitHub 上源码的<u>版本对比功能</u>来一点一点更新代码。</p></blockquote><h2 id="自定义美化魔改技巧"><a href="#自定义美化魔改技巧" class="headerlink" title="自定义美化魔改技巧"></a>自定义美化魔改技巧</h2><blockquote><p>前提：对 html、css、js 有一定的了解，最好有系统的学习，会使你事半功倍。</p><p>本栏分享的技巧包括<u>自定义美化魔改、如何模仿他人网站的布局、样式、动态功能</u>。</p></blockquote><ol><li><p><strong>善用<code>F12</code></strong></p><p><code>F12</code>通常用于对 css 样式的捕捉定位。你看到别人网站某个地方很好看，可以按下<code>F12</code>键，用鼠标定位到那里，将会弹出一个代码框，左栏是 html 代码，右栏是与选中元素对应的相关 css 代码以及全局通用 css 代码，将对应代码粘在自定义 css 文件里即可。若本地渲染后没有效果，可能是样式定位失败或者代码语法错误。</p></li><li><p><strong>善用<code>Ctrl + U</code></strong></p><p><code>Ctrl + U</code>用于查看当前网页的源码（并非整个博客源码），再按下<code>Ctrl + F</code>搜索例如像<code>.js</code>的关键词，即可查看博主在该页面使用到的 js 代码，逐个打开看或者“见名知意”来选择性的打开，这样有助于快速定位到网页对应板块使用到的 js 代码，除了搜索<code>.js</code>你也可以搜索<code>.css</code>、<code>.png</code>、<code>.jpg</code>等关键词来获取相应文件，当然使用时先得遵守各位博主的<a href="https://blog.harriswong.top/cc/">版权协议</a>。</p></li><li><p>有时候想<strong>调整页面布局</strong>，通常是<u>更改 pug 源码</u>，pug 是种类似于 html 的代码语言。若你想调整某板块的布局，先用 F12 获取它的 class 或 id，通过在代码编辑器里搜索关键词定位到 pug 源码，做适当更改，严格注意代码的缩进，Hexo 三连后即可看到效果。</p></li><li><p>最后，你的<u>模仿能力和英语不至于太差</u>。善于模仿代码语言的编写格式和能直接通过英文看懂代码含义，有助于你去美化魔改，很适合像我这种对语言不熟但又想改它的人。比如，我将 fontawesome 图标换成阿里图标后，发现它不能旋转，于是我在 vscode 代码编辑工具里全局搜索<code>360</code>，就搜到了类似于<code>(-100px) rotate(-360deg)</code>的代码，通过英文意思能大概知道是旋转 360 度的功能，但据观察推测，styl 和 css 应该是差不多的语言，只是语法不同，而且 styl 单词长得像 style 单词？于是我将该部分代码移植到对应处，效果就有了，建议友友们多思考多实践。</p></li></ol><div class="note warning no-icon flat"><p>注意：第 4 条是一个跳过编程语言学习、走捷径的方法（<del>耍小聪明</del>），在此仅提供思路，不具有普适性也不推荐，还是建议深入了解前端知识，有想法有能力者最好系统学习下，毕竟磨刀不误砍柴工嘛（严肃）。</p></div><h2 id="如何添加自定义-css、js-代码"><a href="#如何添加自定义-css、js-代码" class="headerlink" title="如何添加自定义 css、js 代码"></a>如何添加自定义 css、js 代码</h2><p>修改<code>&lt;BlogRoot&gt;\themes\butterfly\_config.yml</code>或<code>&lt;BlogRoot&gt;\_config.butterfly.yml</code>（如果你创建了）的代码</p><figure class="highlight diff"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">inject:</span><br><span class="line">  head:</span><br><span class="line">    # - &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/xxx.css&quot;&gt;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="addition">+   - &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;&lt;FilePath_&lt;Custom&gt;.css&gt;&quot;  media=&quot;defer&quot; onload=&quot;this.media=&#x27;all&#x27;&quot;&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">  bottom:</span><br><span class="line">    # - &lt;script src=&quot;xxxx&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="addition">+   - &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;&lt;FilePath_&lt;Custom&gt;.js&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><br><blockquote><p><strong>结束语</strong>：</p><p>如果你很多概念看不懂的话，建议百度深入了解、系统学习。如果哪个地方表述有问题，欢迎留言！</p></blockquote>]]></content>

class='content'>              <p>现在我转而用 Heson 的哔哔项目了，因为腾讯云莫名其妙不能调用哔哔内容，其实刚开始还是可以的。我前前后后反复找原因，甚至重新按教程搭建了 2 次腾讯云后台还是调用不了，于是我开始猜测是不是主题升级的原因，但我将升级之前代码的 download 下来 hexo s 后居然可以正常显示哔哔内容，很奇怪，但是我都已经费老大心思升级了难不成还退回去？更离谱的还有，我在分析原因的时候，不知道碰了个什么 bb 相关代码，突然能正常显示，过了会又不能显示，最后，还有离谱的事情，我突然发现腾讯云后台权限配置莫名其妙改了，我直接黑人问号，我明明配置好了，什么时候就自动改了，然后我将权限改成<u>管理员能改所有人能看</u>，唉，就能正常显示了嘿嘿，你以为这就万事大吉了？很气，过了一段时间，哔哔内容又不能正常显示，我在想应该是权限的原因吧？结果到腾讯云一看，这回权限老老实实是开的，但不知道又 tm 哪出问题了，我急了我急了，索性我转战叨叨（一个仿哔哔项目），我配置了半天，好不容易快结束，结果，唉，vercel 的 api 突然死活发不了哔哔，问教程博主也无济于事，爬！爷生气了，我还是挺细心的去按照教程操作，结果就这，最后啊，我最终选择了 leancloud 后台的哔哔项目，感谢 heson 大佬，他还做了蜜云版哔哔（可称为情侣哔哔），非常养眼的一个哔哔项目，i 了 i 了，适合虐自己(dog)，但缺点是只能在微信公众号发，现在不支持 IOS 快捷指令，以及增删改查合并一些操作，不过每次发之前想好措辞即可，实在不行打开后台改也是一样，我目前勉强能习惯吧（因为我别无选择，不想再重新试了！Heson 的也挺好）</p>              </div>            </details><br><h2 id="社交图标使用多色-svg"><a

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="白嫖什么意思？"><a href="#白嫖什么意思？" class="headerlink" title="白嫖什么意思？"></a>白嫖什么意思？</h2><p><a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%99%BD%E5%AB%96/22207531?fr=aladdin">百度百科</a>上说：它是网络流行词，由最早不给钱吃“霸王餐”的白嫖一词演变而来，后流行于饭圈、游戏圈。意思为粉上一个偶像，不为 Ta 花钱——不买专辑不买周边不看演唱会不买电影票，却又享用其 Ta 资源的人。后引申泛指免费索取他人资源的行为。简单说就是<strong>不花费任何资源去享受某件事情</strong>。</p><p>看完百度百科，想到我去年追女团选秀时没在打投上花过一分钱一事，尽管 WCX 是我最喜欢的女选手，甚至辗转反侧夜不能寐，但在我看来，追星这件事，应尊重每个人的想法与做法，打投不花钱本是件无可厚非的事情，难道给偶像相关报道点赞评论转发、为 Ta 投票不算是对 Ta 的正向反馈吗？说到底自己追的快乐才是真谛，拒绝任何道德绑架。而本篇<strong>主要谈论白嫖的对象是网络资源</strong>，并非饭圈或游戏圈上的。</p><h2 id="白嫖现象"><a href="#白嫖现象" class="headerlink" title="白嫖现象"></a>白嫖现象</h2><p>从我上大学以来，发现周围和网上白嫖的人越来越多了。有句话大家应该耳熟能详：“白嫖一时爽，一直白嫖一直爽”，你们反问下自己，真的爽吗？那确实爽（来自博主的肯定 👍），不花一分钱能得到自己想要的东西，绝大多数人都会感到开心，但你是否和我一样有忙于去搜集免费资源而浪费大量时间的苦恼呢？hh，继续谈谈我自己的见解与思考 👇</p><h2 id="白嫖的原因？"><a href="#白嫖的原因？" class="headerlink" title="白嫖的原因？"></a>白嫖的原因？</h2><p><strong>原因一</strong>：与<strong>家境贫寒，勤俭节约习惯</strong>有关，<del>别问，问就是 qiong</del>。当然判断自己是否贫富的这杆秤在大多数人心里都是相对的，而并非绝对的，比如你认为发达城市贫穷家庭和乡镇地区富裕家庭能比较吗？根本没有可比性。谈谈我自己吧，我家并不是那么宽裕，家人工作很辛苦非常不容易，我从小在勤俭节约家风的耳濡目染下，自然而然不那么败家，对钱的出入比较敏感，好处就是我收获到了父母在金钱上不限制我的 privilege，乍一看挺好的，但也使我变得精打细算起来，甚至成了老白嫖选手。</p><p><strong>原因二</strong>：与<strong>巨婴心理</strong>有关。觉得别人做什么都是轻而易举的，别人对自己的好是理所当然，自己也心安理得去接受。这类人的惯性思维是：“你都有这么多了，给我用点有什么关系？反正你也不用”，要知道给你是我的情份，不给你是我的本份，做人呐，要常怀感恩之心。</p><p><strong>原因三</strong>：与你的<strong>资源搜集能力</strong>有关。当然这点不具有普适性，谈谈我自己吧，我是计算机专业，自从接触到这个领域，我发觉自己的资源搜索能力越来越强，一般 PDF 资源、付费软件、付费网课、付费影视、付费音乐等资源大多数都能在互联网的犄角旮旯里找到。当然，资源搜集能力和喜不喜欢白嫖其实没有必然联系，但只要你稍微有白嫖的习惯，你倾向白嫖的程度会随着搜集能力增强而提高，同时，你的搜集能力也会随着喜欢白嫖程度提高而增强，这就是为什么越来越多的人容易陷进白嫖的漩涡。</p><h2 id="白嫖的利弊？"><a href="#白嫖的利弊？" class="headerlink" title="白嫖的利弊？"></a>白嫖的利弊？</h2><p>白嫖能让你不花一分钱并享受到你想要的东西，但是你会浪费大量时间在资源搜集上，使你出手不会那么阔绰、豪爽。先说说白嫖给我思维观念带来的变化，我发现我越来越为自己不去买某些必需品而找理由，我潜意识会认为它没有那么必要，或者说能找到同等低廉替代物，甚至是免费的，买任何一件物品都会思考再三，货比三家，四处搜索，但结果很累很狼狈。我觉得<u>在某种程度上白嫖和省钱可以相提并论</u>，有时候你可能会因为省点钱而放弃重要的事情，甚至可能连事情的重要性都拿捏不稳，你可能短时间享受到了不用付出的快乐，但眼光放长远，你很可能下错了一步人生大棋。比如，你有一场重要的面试，你因省钱选择了搭乘公交，最后因迟到而错失了面试机会；你未来有场重要的考试，而你为了省钱，在网上找那种质量掺水且没有老师一对一服务的资源而决定自学，最终却因此没考过而选择二战。这些例子不胜枚举，尽管若你能力强，这些便不是问题，但有时候花一点小钱，却会给你带来更大的好处，难道节省下来的时间不是更重要吗？你拥有了无价的知识和时间，这些间接为你未来的发展起到促进作用，你现在节约下来的钱以后可能不到一个月就可以赚回来，难道不是吗？</p><h2 id="那我以后就不白嫖了？"><a href="#那我以后就不白嫖了？" class="headerlink" title="那我以后就不白嫖了？"></a>那我以后就不白嫖了？</h2><p>要知道，白嫖它并不是一个贬义词，更多的是<strong>中性</strong>，有时候别人热心免费分享给你一些资源或教程，你用了这没多大问题，至于你感不感谢 Ta 那是人情世故，只是不要喜欢占别人便宜，得了便宜还卖乖，得不到就骂骂咧咧，那种白嫖真的很狼狈，受人鄙视、唾弃。</p><h2 id="博主我做了哪些改变？"><a href="#博主我做了哪些改变？" class="headerlink" title="博主我做了哪些改变？"></a>博主我做了哪些改变？</h2><p>其实我曾一度是白嫖型选手，我目前也在尝试做出一些改变，比如偶尔打个赏，给某 App 充个会员等等，这是此前不会考虑的事情。最后，对于节约型白嫖选手我想说，要学会爱自己，将钱花在刀刃上很重要，不要顾此失彼；对巨婴型白嫖选手想说，不求你任何回报，哪怕一句谢谢也行，这样才能让免费分享的一片爱心得以延续下去。Peace &amp; Love！</p><p><del>（看到文章下面的 Trick or Treat 按钮了吗？哦，原来是个摆设呀 🙈555）</del></p>]]></content>

      <title>如何写说唱歌词？</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>前言：</p><p>友友们可能第一时间想问：宁配吗？作品发来看看？观众姥爷们稍安勿躁，<del>我想象力过于丰富</del>，截止目前 2021.3.19，<span class="hide-inline"><button type="button" class="hide-button" style="background-color: #1fc7b6;color: #fff">听我狡辩   </button><span class="hide-content">我已经写了些许“作品”，本来想着寒假发，由于要准备留学和本人时间管理能力极差，所以一直拖到现在，今年暑假也不能确定能否顺利发行歌曲，可能还要实习OMG </span></span>。首先这都是我实践过程中总结的经验，部分有参考其他优秀音乐人的做法。本文章大伙们<del>图一乐涨涨姿势</del>就行，若能学到一些哪怕仅仅领悟到了一些，It would be great! 如果有些比较专业的地方不太懂建议先百度，B 站上找找相关教程，多听歌培养 Hip-hop 的 feel，本篇仅提供写词思路步骤，也欢迎评论留言。</p></blockquote><br><h2 id="基本知识"><a href="#基本知识" class="headerlink" title="基本知识"></a>基本知识</h2><blockquote><p>写词前得了解一些基本知识</p></blockquote><h3 id="歌词的元素"><a href="#歌词的元素" class="headerlink" title="歌词的元素"></a>歌词的元素</h3><ol><li><strong>Rhyme</strong>：押韵。这是所有类型歌词的基本元素。</li><li><strong>Punchline</strong>：妙语、点睛之笔。能让歌词瞬间提高档次。表达通常比较隐晦，起到一语双关、讽刺、调侃的作用。一般好的 Punchline 能让听众半秒后眼前一亮，情不自禁的发出<del>woc</del>。</li><li><strong>Flow</strong>：语流。其实目前没有更好的中文翻译，它可描述为一个拍子里唱多少个音节、在哪里停顿、变什么腔调、在哪里突然加速减速、在哪里重读，综合这些组成的是一首歌曲的 flow。这主要体现在唱上面，写词的话可以同时考虑带上 flow 的设计。</li><li><strong>Rythme</strong>：节奏。这个主要是和一首歌的 beat 有关，beat 分很多种类型，比如 trap、old school、Reggae、funk、drill 等等，节奏型都不尽相同，写词的时候可以同时考虑歌词和基本节奏对应起来，重音放在哪里。</li><li><strong>Groove</strong>：律动感。这也是街舞里的元素，律动感和一首歌的 beat、flow 相关，让听众会不由自主较规律的扭动身体。</li><li><strong>Bar</strong>：小节。歌词的一小节，通常会有停顿，在这可以换气准备唱下一句。</li><li><strong>Break</strong>：停顿。唱歌时突然停顿，给听众来个措手不及，有时候 beat 也会配合停下来，过零点几秒后又开始继续（当然了，有时候 Rapper 根据 beat 而设计 break，有时候是 beat 配合歌词来编 break）。用的好的话，和 punchline 一样能使听众眼前一亮，情不自禁的发出<del>wow</del>。一般一首歌中用一两次即可。</li></ol><h3 id="歌曲的组成元素"><a href="#歌曲的组成元素" class="headerlink" title="歌曲的组成元素"></a>歌曲的组成元素</h3><ol><li><strong>Intro</strong>：前奏。为了引出歌曲后面的部分。</li><li><strong>Verse</strong>：主歌。表达 whatever you want 的部分。</li><li><strong>Pre-Hook</strong>：副歌预热。它又叫做 Pre-Chorus， Pre-Hook 出现在副歌的前面，它的作用就是为了引出副歌，为副歌预热。它很少出现在说唱作品里。一般在嘻哈音乐里面，Pre-Hook 通常是 1-2 个小节，虽然一般是几句重复的句子，但是简单洗脑，很容易就能吸引到听众。</li><li><strong>Hook</strong>：副歌。俗称一首歌的高潮部分，看过<em>新说唱</em>的观众应该知道紫琪很喜欢 cue 这个词，其实在其他类型歌曲中副歌叫 Chorus，你一般听到 Hook 这个概念，十有八九就是在谈嘻哈啦。有些 Rapper 可能乐理不太好（<del>低情商</del>）或者单纯的想表达（<del>高情商，开玩笑的</del>），Hook 部分可能是会以说唱的方式来唱，歌词比较精炼通俗易懂，通常是全曲中心思想，可能不会写的那么抽象化、艺术化。</li><li><strong>Bridge</strong>：桥段。verse 和 hook 之间衔接的部分。如果桥段部分的 beat 在 solo（可理解为编曲人想炫技），你可以不写词 hh，很适合你表演时在这趴加些街舞动作。</li><li><strong>Outro</strong>：结尾。一般歌曲到这里整首歌的声音、感情色彩逐渐淡出，意在让听众回味无穷。有些歌曲为了让观众单曲循环，它的结尾和前奏做得几乎一样，可前后无缝衔接。但多数歌曲结尾都是逐渐淡出或者戛然而止，给听众留下想象空间。</li></ol><h3 id="Bar-的组成数量"><a href="#Bar-的组成数量" class="headerlink" title="Bar 的组成数量"></a>Bar 的组成数量</h3><p>顺便补充，歌曲组成元素的单位是 <strong>Bar</strong>，下面介绍下在 <strong>Hiphop</strong> 类歌曲中通常的组成数量：</p><p><strong>Intro</strong>（通常是<strong>4, 8</strong>个 bars，少有的是 2, 12, 16 个 bars）</p><p><strong>Verse</strong>（通常是<strong>8, 16</strong> 个 bars，少有的是 10, 15 个 bars）</p><p><strong>Pre-Hook</strong>（通常是<strong>1, 2</strong>个 bars）</p><p><strong>Hook</strong>（通常是<strong>4, 8, 12, 16</strong>个 bars，少有的是 10, 15 个 bars）</p><p><strong>Bridge</strong>（通常是<strong>4, 8</strong>个 bars，少有的是 12 个 bars）</p><p><strong>Outro</strong>（通常是<strong>4, 8, 16</strong>个 bars，少有的是超过 16 个 bars）</p><h3 id="歌曲的组成结构"><a href="#歌曲的组成结构" class="headerlink" title="歌曲的组成结构"></a>歌曲的组成结构</h3><p>常见的有：</p><p><u>Intro(4 节) -

We are working on narrowing the gap between our points of view. 缩小差距<br>E.g. We’re working to narrow down the list of possible suspects.<br>E.g. The smoking causes the same diseases in women as in men and the gap between their death rates is narrowing.</p><p><strong>define</strong> (v.): 这个词大家以前熟悉的意思是给……下定义, 这个意思和限制并不矛盾，什么叫下定义？就是描述出一个事物的轮廓，所以定义就是在一个给定的范围内给一个事物限定的特定的意思。（define 的英文解释： If you define something, you show, describe, or state clearly what it is and what its limits are, or what it is like）<br>E.g. The Supreme Court decision could define how far Congress can go in trying to determine the outcome of court cases.</p><p><strong>cap</strong> (n./v.): 这个词最常用的意思是帽子的意思，作为限制的意思再形象不过了。</p><p>E.g. The government has placed a cap on local council spending.<br>snow-capped mountains</p><blockquote><p>补充信息：魔兽世界（WOW）的资料片燃烧的远征（TBC）刚刚推出的时候，在官网上就有这么句话：An increase in the level cap to 70 大家不妨体会下这句话中的 cap 的意思在 NBA 里面就有工资帽这种说法（工资帽的概念 1984 年被引入，NBA 联盟和球员工会之间首先进行谈判，只有双方同意，工资帽才被正式公布。每年 NBA 的工资帽都在增加，1997-98 赛季是 2690 万美元，上赛季是 4384 万美元，而如今则是 4387 万美元。那么什么是工资帽呢？工资帽的具体数额和 NBA 前一年的总收入密切相关。具体来说，这个工资帽是根据 NBA 前一年的总收入，然后取这个总收入的 48％作为 NBA 球队花钱的资本，再拿这个 48％后的收入再除以 29（NBA 上赛季球队总数），得出的平均数就是当年的工资帽，各球队花在球员身上的工资总额不得超过这个数字。</p></blockquote><h3 id="集中，聚焦于"><a href="#集中，聚焦于" class="headerlink" title="集中，聚焦于"></a>集中，聚焦于</h3><blockquote><p>focus on, concentrate on, aim, spotlight, be engrossed in, lay/place/put emphasis on, deal only with, highlight,</p></blockquote><p><strong>spotlight</strong>(v./n.): 本意是聚光灯的意思<br>E.g. A new report has turned the spotlight on the problem of poverty in the inner cities.<br>E.g. The report has turned the spotlight on the startling rise in street crime.<br>E.g. Unemployment is once again in the spotlight.<br>E.g. The article spotlights the problems of the homeless.</p><p><strong>engross</strong> (v.): 全神贯注于某事<br>E.g. The scene was stunning, and for a time engrossed all our attention.<br>E.g. He was so engrossed in his book that he didn’t hear her come in.</p><p><strong>highlight</strong>(v./n.): 本意为用高亮度标记<br>E.g. The incident has served to highlight the problems of urban deprivation.|<br>highlight 作名词用表示一系列事情的亮点，高潮，最精彩所在，<br>E.g. That weekend in Venice was definitely the highlight of our trip.<br>E.g. The highlight of the trip was visiting the Great Wall of China.</p><h3 id="现代的，最新的："><a href="#现代的，最新的：" class="headerlink" title="现代的，最新的："></a>现代的，最新的：</h3><blockquote><p>contemporary, modern, current, present, recent, up-to-date, latest</p></blockquote><p>这里需要注意 latest 不要翻成最晚的，是最新的，最近的意思</p><p><strong>up-to-date</strong>(a.): 最新的<br>E.g. They have access to up-to-date information through a computer database.</p><p><strong>latest</strong> (a.):最新的<br>E.g. the latest fashions from the Paris catwalks.</p><p><strong>contemporary</strong>: 现代的</p><p>这个词准确的来说和最近的（latest）意思还是有区别的，不果的阅读考试大部分词考得都是词和词之间的相关性，其实也不太有可能两个词的意思是完全一样的，一般来说只要他们意思相关，并且不发生矛盾的话，我们就可以认为他们之间是同义词。这也就是为什么 contemporary 会和 latest 在一组的原因了。</p><h3 id="增长："><a href="#增长：" class="headerlink" title="增长："></a>增长：</h3><blockquote><p>grow, increase, expand, rise, improve, soar, climb, extend, rocket,</p></blockquote><p>improve: 这个词在这里需要强调下，这个词在某些特定的场合下甚至可以表示下降的意思，例如：犯罪率在 improve，像这种不好的事情得到了改善<br><strong>soar</strong> (v.): 飙升<br>E.g. The price of petrol has soared in recent weeks.</p><p><strong>rocket</strong>(v./n.):作名词是火箭的意思, 动词: 直线上升<br>E.g. Stock prices rocketed to their highest level yesterday.这组词在阅读和写作当中可能会发生词性的变化，主要是形容词，动词和名词这三种间的转换。</p><p>grow-growing-growth</p><p>increase-increasing-increase</p><p>expand-expanding- expansion</p><p>rise-rising-rise</p><p>improve-improved-improvement</p><p>extend-extended-extension</p><p>climb-climbing-climb</p><h3 id="悲观的，忧郁的"><a href="#悲观的，忧郁的" class="headerlink" title="悲观的，忧郁的"></a>悲观的，忧郁的</h3><blockquote><p>pessimistic, gloomy, depressed, depressing, hopeless, sad, blue, unhappy, low-spirited, mournful, dismal, miserable, glum, broken-hearted , down in the dumps(informal),</p></blockquote><p><strong>pessimistic</strong>(a.):悲观的<br>E.g. Doctors are pessimistic about his chances of making a full recovery.</p><p><strong>gloomy</strong> (a.): 衰退的, 忧郁的,<br>E.g. Frank dismissed these gloomy thoughts from her mind.</p><p><strong>blue</strong> (a.): 这个词可以解释为蓝调即悲伤忧郁的音乐,不过只能用复数形式 blues<br>E.g. She usually calls her mother when she’s feeling blue.<br>blue 这个词还有高贵的意思，例如这个短语：blue-blooded 表示出生于皇室家族或者社会地位很高的家族<br>blue book 这个词大家可千万不要多想，它一般指英国官方发布的蓝皮书（封面通常是蓝色的）（yellow pages 黄页即包含电话号码和公司地址的黄色封面的书）<br>blue movie 色情电影，不过这种用法差不多已经过时了，现在一般都说 porn movie<br>blue chip 蓝筹股即表现优异的，或者值得投资的股票<br>blue collar 蓝领</p><h3 id="加速，前进"><a href="#加速，前进" class="headerlink" title="加速，前进"></a>加速，前进</h3><blockquote><p>accelerate, speed up, advance, hasten, quicken, develop, hurry</p></blockquote><p><strong>accelerate</strong>(v.)：物理学中的加速度就是这个单词<br>E.g. The decline of her health seemed to suddenly accelerate.</p><p><strong>develop</strong> (v.): 发展，也就是说现在的速度比原先的快才能叫发展，所以 develop 和和加速这个意思是属于相关词<br>在这里需要强调一下，英文当中越简单的东西，它的用法是越丰富的，这里简单列几个 develop 常用的几个词条<br>develop liver disease 得病<br>develop the pictures 冲照片</p><p><strong>advance</strong>(v.): 进步，前进<br>E.g. The group&#39;s research has done much to advance our knowledge of the HIV virus.</p><h3 id="相似的，相同的"><a href="#相似的，相同的" class="headerlink" title="相似的，相同的"></a>相似的，相同的</h3><blockquote><p>similar, alike, resemble, same, resemble, identical, still(这个词需要体会), analogous, twin,</p></blockquote><p><strong>alike</strong> (a.):</p><p>E.g. The two versions of the text are alike in many ways.<br>resemble(v.):</p><p>E.g. Soldiers are trained under conditions that closely resemble real combat.<br>identical (a.):</p><p>E.g. This house is almost identical to the one where I lived as a child.</p><p><strong>still</strong>: 仍然 这个词放在这里大家不要觉得很奇怪，大家想想看，如果两句话用 still 相连接，是不是表示两句话当中肯定有相同的事情发生呢？例：十多年过去了，我仍然……后半句话我没有写完，但相信大家都能看出我在十年后肯定有和十年前相同的地方。所以 still 是个信号词，是 same 的相关词</p><p><strong>analogous</strong> (a.):</p><p>E.g. Marine construction technology like this is very complex, somewhat analogous to trying to build a bridge under water.<br>twin (n./v./a.): 记住阿娇和阿萨就记住这个单词了，本意是双胞胎的意思<br>E.g. identical twin<br>E.g. the twin problems of poverty and unemployment/ Meet my twin sister.<br>E.g. The opera twins the themes of love and death.<br>E.g. Chichester in England is twinned with Chartres in France.</p><h3 id="颜色"><a href="#颜色" class="headerlink" title="颜色"></a>颜色</h3><blockquote><p>colour(red, blue, brown, etc.),hue, pigment, shade, tint, tone, dye,</p></blockquote><p>首先需要和大家说明的是 colour 的同义词并不是很多，从上的变化来看，对颜色的变化集中在将 colour 变成几种具体的颜色，这需要大家在考试的时候尤其注意。</p><p><strong>hue</strong> (n.): 色彩/观点，信念<br>E.g. Her paintings capture the subtle hues of the countryside in autumn.<br>E.g. political opinions of every hue (= of many kinds)<br>表示深色的形容词：dark, deep, rich<br>表示浅色的形容词：light, pale, soft, pastel<br>表示颜色很鲜艳，很亮的形容词：bright, brilliant, vivid,</p><p><strong>shade</strong> (n.): 色调，颜色的深浅<br>E.g. a delicate / pale / rich / soft shade of red</p><p><strong>pigment</strong>, <strong>dye</strong> (n.): 颜料，染料<br>tint 和 tone 不需要掌握，大家只需要知道他们两个都是表示颜色的，只需要看到认识，不需要掌握用法。</p><h3 id="重要的-必要的-必不可少的-关键的-有意义的"><a href="#重要的-必要的-必不可少的-关键的-有意义的" class="headerlink" title="重要的,必要的,必不可少的,关键的,有意义的"></a>重要的,必要的,必不可少的,关键的,有意义的</h3><blockquote><p>important,significant,seminal,weighty,critical,momentous,vital,essential,crucial,indispensable,necessary,key,pivotal, chief, principal, leading, historic, (反义词：unimportant, trivial, minor, irrelevant, insignificant)</p></blockquote><p>这组词不仅在阅读中很重要，在写作中也尤为值得一提，这组词直接的或者间接的都表示重要的意思。<br><strong>significant</strong> (a. ):</p><p>E.g. Volunteer tutoring programs can have a significant impact on student achievement.</p><p>significant 还可以表示变化很大或者大量的意思：<br>E.g. A significant number of drivers still refuse to wear seat belts.</p><p><strong>critical</strong> (a.): 至关重要的，危及的<br>E.g. Foreign trade is of critical importance to the economy.<br>Eight people were killed and four are still in a critical condition.<br>题外话：critical point 在游戏中可以指暴击点数的意思</p><p><strong>momentous</strong>(a. ): 有意义的<br>E.g. The revolution taking place in Eastern Europe must be counted as one of the most momentous events of this century.</p><p><strong>vital</strong> (a.): E.g. Regular exercise is vital for your health.<br>E.g. The tourist industry is of vital importance to the national economy. (of vital importance= very important)</p><p>vital signs: 生命特征（判断一个人是否还活着，例如心跳，体温等）</p><p><strong>indispensable</strong> (a.): 必不可少的<br>E.g. International cooperation is indispensable to resolving the problem of the drug trade.</p><p><strong>necessary</strong>：这个词可以说是这组词里最简单，但也是最容易弄错的一个，很多学生都会说必要的和重要的是有不同的：重要的不一定是必要的，但必要的一定是重要的。关于这点的解释大家可以参考上面的 similar 和 same 的解释。</p><h3 id="紧急的，迫不及待的-临近的"><a href="#紧急的，迫不及待的-临近的" class="headerlink" title="紧急的，迫不及待的,临近的"></a>紧急的，迫不及待的,临近的</h3><blockquote><p>urgent, pressing, crucial, critical, immediate, emergent,</p></blockquote><p><strong>pressing</strong>(a.): E.g. Poverty is a more pressing problem than pollution.</p><p><strong>immediate</strong> (a. ): 急切的，迫切的，接近/临近的（这个词条非常常用，特别是后面接地点的时候，基本上都是表示接近和靠近的意思）<br>E.g. There is an immediate danger of war.<br>E.g. It is a thriving shopping centre for the people who live in the immediate (=local) area.</p><p><strong>immediate family</strong>: 直系亲属（父母， 子女，兄弟姐妹等）</p><h3 id="长期的，慢性的"><a href="#长期的，慢性的" class="headerlink" title="长期的，慢性的"></a>长期的，慢性的</h3><blockquote><p>chronic, persistent, long-term, habitual, long-standing, 反义词：acute</p></blockquote><p><strong>chronic</strong>(a.): 这个单词的本意是慢性的，引申出长期的意思，或者说是这个单词的解释中包含长期的意思。<br>E.g. chronic heart disease<br>E.g. There is a chronic shortage of teachers.<br>E.g. He was a chronic alcoholic and unable to hold down a job. /chronic gambler<br>chron-这个前缀和时间有关，chronicle 编年史（把历史事件按照时间来排列编成的一本书）（来自希腊神话中宙斯(Zeus)他老爸的名字：Cronos。该神害怕自己的子女反抗自己，曾吞食了自己的后代，就象时间的无情，吞噬一切---利用古罗马，古希腊的神话故事来背单词是种不错的培养兴趣的背单词的方法， 而且在的写作中有很多还可以用得上， 何乐而不为，在随后的词条中会陆续介绍）chronometer 计时仪（常用语科学领域的）</p><p><strong>habitual</strong> (a.): 习惯性的（养成习惯了，那肯定是长期形成的）<br>E.g. an habitual smoker/​drinker/​liar/​criminal</p><p><strong>long-standing</strong> (a.):</p><p>E.g. a long-standing relationship/debate</p><h3 id="人工的，人造的，合成的"><a href="#人工的，人造的，合成的" class="headerlink" title="人工的，人造的，合成的"></a>人工的，人造的，合成的</h3><blockquote><p>artificial, synthetic, false, man-made, manufactured, artificial intelligence(AI)=machine reasoning</p></blockquote><p><strong>artificial</strong> (a.): 人工的<br>E.g. an artificial limb / flower / sweetener / fertilizer/colours</p><p><strong>synthetic</strong> (a.): 人工合成的<br>E.g. synthetic rubber</p><p><strong>false</strong> (a.): 假的，错误的（在某些时候人工的，合成的，不就是大家眼中的假货么？不是到大家有没有看过前段时间电视台的那个激情四溢的侯总，他说的仿钻不就是我们所说的假货么，大家好好体会）</p><p><strong>false teeth/hair/eyelashes</strong> etc 假牙/假发/假睫毛</p><p><strong>false friend</strong>: 就是来自一对不同两个语言的词（或者是两个字母表中的字母）看起来或者是听起来相仿，但是意义完全不同．例如 busboy 看上去很像是汽车售票员，确是表示餐厅勤杂工的意思（这样的例子还有很多）</p><p><strong>manufactured</strong> (a.): 人造的（其实 manu-这个前缀本来是表示用手工制造的意思，但是随着时间的推移，这个前缀已经逐渐转变为用机器大批量制造的意思了，例如：The firm manufactures women’s clothing.）<br>E.g. a news story manufactured by an unscrupulous journalist</p><h3 id="联系-连接-绑定"><a href="#联系-连接-绑定" class="headerlink" title="联系,连接,绑定"></a>联系,连接,绑定</h3><blockquote><p>link, associate, connect, relate, tie, unite, attach, bind,</p></blockquote><p><strong>tie</strong> (v.): E.g. My social life and business life are closely tied.<br>tie 作名词有领结和平局的意思</p><p>E.g. The first game ended in a tie.<br>E.g. Jason had taken off his jacket and loosened his tie.(=necktie)<br>tie the knot 结婚(非正式说法，一种很形象化的说法：打上蝴蝶结，类似于我们中文中的说法：结为连理或者走进教堂这种间接的说法)</p><p><strong>attach</strong> (v.): 附加，固定<br>E.g. A copy of my resume is attached to this letter.<br><strong>attachment</strong> (n.): E.g. old people&#39;s attachment to traditional customs 忠诚<br>E.g. I&#39;ll send the spreadsheet as an attachment. 附件<br>E.g. a child&#39;s attachment to its mother 依恋</p><p><strong>bind</strong> (v.) 绑定 这个词的发音和汉语解释绑定非常的接近，可以帮助大家记忆(Bind on Acquire/Bind on equipment 打过魔兽世界的应该很熟悉这两个短语吧：拾取后绑定和装备后绑定)<br>最后需要大家在写作中注意这几个动词和介词的搭配：<br>link A to/with B; associate A with B; connect A to/with B; tie A to B; relate A to B; bind A to B;</p><h3 id="足够的，充分的-大量的"><a href="#足够的，充分的-大量的" class="headerlink" title="足够的，充分的,大量的"></a>足够的，充分的,大量的</h3><blockquote><p>sufficient, adequate, enough, abundant, ample, plenty of ,considerable, plentiful,</p></blockquote><p><strong>sufficient</strong> (a.): E.g. sufficient time/​resources/​information 反义词：insufficient<br>E.g. Will the growth in output be sufficient to meet the increased demand?</p><p><strong>adequate</strong> (a.): E.g. an adequate supply of hot water 反义词：inadequate<br>E.g. There is a lack of adequate provision for disabled students.</p><p><strong>abundant</strong> (a.): E.g.

We&#39;ve saved a considerable amount of money.</p><h3 id="战争，军事"><a href="#战争，军事" class="headerlink" title="战争，军事"></a>战争，军事</h3><blockquote><p>military,army,battle(field),armed forces,attack,combat,conflict,crusade,war, the services,</p></blockquote><p><strong>armed forces</strong>: 武装部队/力量 arm 本意是胳膊的，动词的意思是装备的意思（equip）,所以 armed 解释为武装的<br>E.g.

id="月份来历"><a href="#月份来历" class="headerlink" title="月份来历"></a>月份来历</h3><p>下面给大家简单介绍下罗马历中十二个月份的来历（很多考生不明白为什么 October 十月的前缀表示的是数字八的意思）：</p><p>公历一年有 12 个月，起源于古罗马历法。罗马原来只有 10 个月，古罗马皇帝决定增加两个月放在年尾，后来朱里斯·凯撒大帝把这两个月移到年初，成为 1 月、2 月，原来的 1 月、2 月便成了 3 月、4 月，依次类推。这就是今天世界沿用的公历。</p><p>January——1 月　　在罗马传说中，有一位名叫雅努斯的守护神，生有先后两副脸，一副回顾过去，一副要眺望未来。人们认为选择他的名字作为除旧迎新的第一个月月名，很有意义。英语 January，便是由这位守护神的拉丁文名字演变而来的。</p><p>February——2 月　　每年 2 月初，罗马人民都要杀牲饮酒，欢庆菲勃卢姆节。这一天，人们常用一种牛、草制成的名叫 Februa 的鞭子，抽打不育的妇女，以求怀孕生子。这一天，人们还要忏悔自己过去一年的罪过，洗刷自己的灵魂，求得神明的饶恕，使自己成为一个贞洁的人。英语 2 月 February，便是由拉丁文 Februar-ius（即菲勃卢姆节）演变而来。</p><p>March——3 月　　 3 月，原是罗马旧历法的 1 月，新年的开始。凯撒大帝改革历法后，原来的 1 月变成 3 月，但罗马人仍然把 3 月看做是一年的开始。另外，按照传统习惯，3 月是每年出征远战的季节。为了纪念战神玛尔斯，人们便把这位战神的拉丁名字作为 3 月的月名。英语 3 月 March，便是由这位战神的名字演变而来的。</p><p>April——4 月　　罗马的 4 月，正是大地回春，鲜花初绽的美好季节。</p><p>May——5 月　　罗马神话中的女神玛雅，专门司管春天和生命。为了纪念这位女神，罗马人便用她的名字——拉丁文 Maius 命名 5 月，英文 5 月 May 便由这位女神的名字演变而来。</p><p>June——6 月　　罗马神话中的裘诺，是众神之王，又是司管生育和保护妇女的神。古罗马对她十分崇敬，便把 6 月奉献给她，以她的名字——拉丁文 Junius 来命名 6 月。英语 6 月 June 便由这位女神的名字演变而来。也有学者认为，Junius 可能是拉丁家族中一个显赫贵族的姓氏。</p><p>July——7 月　　罗马统治者朱里斯·凯撒大帝被刺死后，著名的罗马将军马克·安东尼建议将凯撒大帝诞生的 7 月，用凯撒的名字——拉丁文 Julius（即朱里斯）命名之。这一建议得到了元老院的通过。英语 7 月 July 由此演变而来。</p><p>August——8 月　　朱里斯·凯撒死后，由他的甥孙屋大维续任罗马皇帝。为了和凯撒齐名，他也想用自己的名字来命名一个月份。他的生日在 9 月，但他选定 8 月。因为他登基后，罗马元老院在 8 月授予他 Augustus（奥古斯都）的尊号。于是，他决定用这个尊号来命名 8 月。原来 8 月比 7 月少一天，为了和凯撒平起平坐，他又决定从 2 月中抽出一天加在 8 月上。从此，2 月便少了一天。英语 8 月 August 便由这位皇帝的拉丁语尊号演变而来。</p><p>September——9 月　　老历法的 7 月，正是凯撒大帝改革历法后的 9 月，拉丁文 Septem 是“7”月的意思。虽然历法改革了，但人们仍袭用旧名称来称呼 9 月。英语 9 月 September，便由此演变而来。</p><p>October——10 月　　英语 10 月，来自拉丁文 Octo，即“8”的意思。它和上面讲的 9 月一样，历法改了，称呼仍然沿用未变。</p><p>November——11 月　　罗马皇帝奥古斯都和凯撒都有了自己名字命名的月份，罗马市民和元老院要求当时的罗马皇帝梯比里乌斯用其名命名 11 月。但梯比里乌斯没有同意，他明智地对大家说，如果罗马每个皇帝都用自己的名字来命名月份，那么出现了第 13 个皇帝怎么办？于是，11 月仍然保留着旧称 Novem，即拉丁文“9”的意思。英语 11 月 November 便由此演变而来。</p><p>December——12 月 罗马皇帝琉西乌斯要把一年中最后一个月用他情妇的 Amagonius 的名字来命名，但遭到元老院的反对。于是，12 月仍然沿用旧名 Decem，即拉丁文&quot;10&quot;的意思。英语 12 月 December，便由此演变而来。</p>]]></content>

右侧<code>下载速度</code>即可。官方说明速度是平均用户的 3.2 倍，而我这是差不多提速了 10 倍，原先是 100kbps 左右，现在 1Mbps 左右。</p><p><strong>方法 2：使用 KinhDown 软件</strong></p><p>优点：下载速度很快，最快几 M 每秒，可以自动读取你剪切板里的链接和密码。<br>缺点：最后只能一个一个文件的下载，不能包含整个文件目录逻辑，而且下载时容易下载失败，但是失败了可关闭再重启软件继续下载就好了，这样多反复横跳，如果你网好，失败的情况就相对少，或者没有，可以试试。</p><p><strong>方法 3：手机百度网盘</strong></p><ol><li>用手机 百度网盘 来下载！</li><li>再导入电脑</li></ol><p>我的电脑下载速度平均 100Kb/s 左右，但用手机下载平均 1.0Mb/s 左右</p><div class="note warning no-icon flat"><p><strong>注意</strong>：经我多次测试，结果发现下载<strong>几个 G 的视频</strong>很快，但下载<strong>exe 软件</strong>很慢（基本原来速度），当然这不能保证所有人都有效，但可以当作你白嫖的 <u>Last choice</u>，但还是墙裂建议试试！</p></div><p>方法 4：买会员</p><p>自己买会员 👍，<del>想白嫖不可能</del>。</p><h2 id="🔥-解除网页限制"><a href="#🔥-解除网页限制" class="headerlink" title="🔥

at &lt;anonymous&gt;:1:1</code>，则可以试试<code>jQuery(“.ie-fix”).text();</code></p></blockquote><p>方法二：直接选中，用鼠标按住不动往文档编辑软件里拖，松开即可看到选中的文字，由于都是文本，所以样式可能还需要后期微调。</p><p>参考视频：<a

<code>&lt;URL&gt;</code>，查看网页源码</li><li>按下<code>Ctrl + F</code>搜索关键词，即可复制你想复制的内容</li></ol><blockquote><p>虽麻烦，但是确实是个不错的解决办法，然后对于复制文本来说，你完全可以利用 QQ 的智能识别文字功能来复制网页内容。</p></blockquote><h2

用了一年半后，手机内存近乎爆满，APP 实在是运行不畅，于是我又在网上找到了个非常 practicable 的方案：<u>先备份数据，再恢复出厂设置，最后再恢复数据</u>。这样手机里只有重要文件，其余不重要的已经全删了，备份数据的时候认真做取舍即可。</p><p><strong>失败原因及方法</strong>：其实是手机内部储存空间不足的问题，经过一番百度，我们大概可知道，它原理是手机备份时，它得先拷贝完整的一份，再将那一份导出到电脑上，而拷贝的那一份是占空间的，手机本来空间就不足，所以也就是选择时注意下所选文件大小，不能超过内存余量！所以你要减少勾选的数量，多备份几次即可解决。原理大概是这样，效果亲测有效。</p><h3

碎碎念，搭建时的艰辛历程 </summary>              <div class='content'>              <p>我开始以为 webstack 可以通过像<code>hexo new page xxx</code>一样简单地直接加到博客导航栏里，但经过半天的实践发现没那么简单，再经过大量搜寻最后发现原来它是一个 Hexo 主题，就是一<strong>独立的网站</strong>，尽管自己已经看到它的文件名叫<code>hexo-theme-webstack</code>。在此之前我还寻思着，这怎么看也不像一个博客网站的 Theme，更像一个小网页，还消耗了我几天的时间去找搭建教程。首先我想吐槽，网上关于 WebStack 的教程本来就很少，而且 WebStack 它还有很多框架版本（本网址导航是 Hexo），就在海淘后零星的几个教程中，又全都是 WebStack <code>config.yml</code>参数配置讲解的教程，哎心累，但现在我终于搭建成功了，我觉得有必要去写我人生中第一个教程（这应该是全网第一篇吧？😂 至少我没找到，可能他们认为这太基础了，默认使用者都会）。最后其实呀，<strong>你只需要像创建你第一个博客那样去创建它</strong>，有搭建 Hexo 博客经验的小伙伴来说，应该简单不少，甚至不用看本篇。</p>              </div>            </details><p>话不多说，先上效果<a class="btn-beautify button--animated outline blue larger" href="https://navi.harriswong.top"

class='content'>              <p>其实我自己在没有教程的情况下能搭建成功网址导航，至少对于刚上道的我来说很骄傲自豪的，但谁 tm 又能想得到，在摸爬滚打的过程中，突然遇到网址图片显示不出来的问题，于是我疯狂百度，也问了很多使用过的博主，都说其他网站可能存在防盗链机制，大致意思是有这个机制的网站，它的图片链接只在自己网站可显示，放其他网站是无法使用的。但当我将所有图片换成我自己仓库的图片时，仍显示不出图片，所以问题不一定出现在图片链接上，也可以说我收藏的那些网站根本没有开防盗链机制。</p><p>于是我花了一周时间找原因，源码对比测试。这一周中，有很多离谱的情况发生，我用<a href="https://dh.xiaokang.me/">小康</a>的源码，图片可以正常显示，但我的就不行，于是我一点一点将他的代码的改成我的，目的是为了找到问题出现在哪一块，但就是找不到问题出现的原因。更离谱的是，经过几天的测试后，我放弃了各种推断，再次全部使用小康的源码准备重新找原因的时候，结果连小康图片都不显示了，那为什么我最开始用他的源码就可以？就在昨天，我又双叒叕用他的源码再次部署到 GitHub 上，再将我的<code>index.html</code>代码和小康的对比，终于发现了原因！我发现我的<code>index.html</code>最后几行缺少<code>lozad.min.js</code>文件的引入，lozad 应该是起图片懒加载的作用，你这就以为我找到了罪魁祸首？真相大白了？我 tm 寻思<code>&lt;BlogRoot&gt;\themes\webstack\_config.yml</code>文件里明明有将这个 js 文件导入，为什么最后生成的 html 文件却没有导入，我此时摸着我凉秃秃的头顶百思不得其姐，现在等于说我已找到了问题和解决方案，只是不知道问题出现的原因，知道原因的小伙伴赶紧留言评论，好让我 s 心。最后十分感谢并墙裂推荐<a

dog.jpg）。如果你选择考雅思 and 在英国留学或生活 and 目前不知道选择什么口音去学习，那我建议首选英式。如果你喜欢美式发音但又想去英国，那么直接用美式这是可以的，像我就是这种情况，而且老外都听得懂，官方评判标准没有哪一项提到必须使用英式或美式，而且我看过的雅思教学视频大都是美式发音。</p></blockquote><h3 id="语法"><a href="#语法"

class="headerlink" title="如何备考当季的 Topics？"></a>如何备考当季的 Topics？</h2><p>其实我不太建议，你专门把所有的 topic 答案写下来。首先你把所有的答案写下来会非常的浪费时间，你可以这么去设想，当你考试的时候，你还在那回忆你当时写了些什么，背了些什么，但是你要知道，在那个过程中，你往往会有一些其它的杂念，其他的 ideas，这种情况下，那些杂念会让你忘掉你之前所记的一些东西，对于口语考试来说只会是一种阻拦，只会让考试变得困难。所以我想给的建议是，你拿到当季所有的 topics 后，你首先得把每一个 topics 在脑子里面过一下，你有哪些想法、你有哪些好的点子、你有哪些想说的，立刻用中文或者是用词伙的方式记录在文档里面，最好别写完整的英文句子，因为你会不自主的去把它一字不漏的背下来。建议的做法是，你每次去练习的时候，你就去记背那些 ideas 就好了，这样你考试中就不会因为你漏掉了之前所准备素材中的一两句话而紧张。其实口语它看中的是你脑子里面有哪些想法，有哪些东西，有哪些故事是可以分享出来的，如果仅仅是靠背的话，我相信，一百个人中估计不到两个人能全部把自己写的都背下来，所以说作为一个普通人，你就好好的去记一些点，每次练习的时候，就把那些点子给串起来，如果串的不好，在练习的过程中，可以来第二次，第三次，无数次，直到你练熟这个 topic 为止。这样你在考试的过程中遇到考官问的题目，你脑子里面会是很多 ideas，而且你也知道有 ideas 了后，该如何去运用你的逻辑，用一些漂亮的表达，把它给串起来。而且同时这样也锻炼了你的随机应变能力，因为你完全不知道考官的下一个问题有多么陌生多么奇葩。</p><p>总而言之，先准备一个文档，将所有 topic 放进去，再来写自己的 ideas，练习过程中再去完善内容（hint）。</p><p><strong>想了解更多关于雅思口语，可以看我的口语笔记</strong>👇</p><div class="tag link"><a class="link-card" title="雅思口语笔记" href="/posts/64250e44/"><div class="left"><img src=

class="headerlink" title="🐭 回顾 2020"></a>🐭 回顾 2020</h2><p>2020 真是多灾多难、光怪陆离的一年。20 年一月初的我，满怀信心的写下了新年计划，之后便目睹了一连串的热搜新闻席卷而来，先是疫情爆发，二是科比坠机逝世等爆点新闻，2020 的开场白实在是不堪入目，为整个 2020 奠定了不详的基调，好在国家的强大，几个月内就基本控制住了疫情，接下来的热搜新闻就是国外各种各样刷新三观的疫情相关操作，川建国同志最为代表人物，承包了我一年的笑点与恨点，近几周，新闻宣称拜振华同志当选为美国总统，我直接好家伙 😂。至于我呢，一整年下来，有进步的地方，也有做的不到位的地方，所以接下来分析分析、总结总结。之前原本想拍个总结视频水下 B 站，毕竟我这不是一年多没有发视频了吗？现在我还不是特别自信，也没预先准备好，最后发了也没人看，羞，决定今年就不拍了，用博客记录也挺好。我觉得以后留学、工作有时间做做兼职 UP 主也是挺好的，我拍摄剪辑技术可不能白白浪费 🤦‍。So, let&#39;s get started!</p><p>根据 2020Target 各大板块逐步分析总结：</p><p><img src= "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/posts/Annual_Target/2020Target.png" alt="2020Target"></p><p>去年总共写了 8 大板块——“<strong>健康</strong>”、“<strong>学习</strong>”、“<strong>活动</strong>”、“<strong>收入</strong>”、“<strong>情感</strong>”、“<strong>外延与内涵</strong>”、“<strong>视频</strong>”和“<strong>音乐</strong>”。</p><h3 id="💪-健康"><a href="#💪-健康" class="headerlink" title="💪 健康"></a>💪 健康</h3><p>首先谈谈第一个板块<strong>健康</strong>。大概是每天要健健身，包括仰卧起坐和举哑铃，乍一看安排的还不戳，如果能够顺利执行，现在肌肉应该粗了一圈吧？😟 这不好笑，喜欢健身的朋友们<del>可能</del>肯定会觉得我这个健身计划没卵用，那为什么我还执意去写呢？因为自己没有花时间去研究合适的锻炼方式，当然计划还是要有的，只是执行力得跟上，现在重心还是过多的放在了学习和爱好上，有时候容易忽视自己的身体健康。2020 上半年在家的时候我还是有刻意的去锻炼，家里买了 2 个瑜伽垫，目的肯定不是练瑜伽 😂，而是做做仰卧起坐、平板支撑和俯卧撑之类的，我练的很随性，没有特别规律，下半年到学校后，每天基本上与健身无缘，几乎天天泡在图书馆，<del>摸鱼</del>。所以，新的一年得继续执行健身计划，从小做起，一点点加大力度。然后是营养方面，每天喝充足的水，每餐要多吃。水的话，在家里喝的少，我家里人不喜欢用饮水机，得自己去院子里打饮用水，然后回来还要再烧开一下，我们家这是何苦呢？每次喝个水特麻烦 🙂，于是无形之中水就喝的少一些，当然了，懒是原罪，我无话可说。。<del>一万个好家伙飞过来</del>，在学校我的每日水量还是挺正常，想喝水随时随地打。然后，2020 计划有提到每餐要多吃，是因为我偏瘦型身材，原本是希望从 140 斤涨到 155，而现在是 145，其实有一段时间到过 150，害，算是小有进步 🙃。最后，睡觉方面，原本希望自己早睡早起，但结果天天翻车，不过在学校情况良好，一回家就乱了套 🙃，心口在滴血。</p><h3 id="✍-学习"><a href="#✍-学习" class="headerlink" title="✍ 学习"></a>✍ 学习</h3><p>第二大板块<strong>学习</strong>，英语方面，六级第一次考了没过，第二次感觉做得比第一次好，但是对完答案，还是感觉小命难保，<del>skr</del>（目前没出分，2 月出），我这是何苦呢？费很多时间去准备结果就这，真该听哥哥姐姐的建议，先准备雅思，两者并不冲突。然后词汇量方面，近几周测了几次，差不多有个 8000，口语方面，记得年初脑子一热，看了北外的口语网课，掌握了一点点知识吧，当然还不够系统，其实不如直接准备雅思，你说这是何苦呢？🙃 属实浪费时间。然后该谈谈我将来的饭碗 - 计算机，计划写着掌握算法、Java、Python，说实话，感觉一直没入门，本人比较浮躁，沉不下心来学习钻研，然后我学的东西比较杂，不成体统，当然还得靠自己慢慢来吧。成绩方面，我本学期还行，应该能达到目标，但是水课成绩普遍比学位课高，到最后绩点还是得看学位课，我大一下和大二上的成绩给我拖了很多后腿，总体绩点想提上来的确很难，得加把劲咯，为了 Family，更为了至己。当然咯，绩点其实不重要，学到真材实料才是真，但留学还是要看绩点的鸭 🙃。。自控方面，每周有坚持写总结，除了偶尔几周，当然这不重要，重要的是每周的自己不一样，<del>我这口气好像做传销的 bushi</del>，对自己狠一点，拒绝拖延和提高效率还有待加强，<del>大佬莫笑</del>。证书方面，驾照一月初就拿了，四级也过了，六级观望中，蓝桥杯省一，软考没有报名，<del>嫌自己太菜</del>，在老师的带领下，还拿了证券投资模拟大赛国二，算是在金融领域沾了个边，从一开始的梭哈，到如今的智慧投资，算是懂了点皮毛，但现实生活中投资需谨慎 😂。现在回顾以往，其实我追求的这些证书轻如鸿毛，只是学习过程中顺手牵的羊，该拿的还是得拿，学到真功夫才是真。技能方面，上半年在小姨家学过烘焙，一下午时间就做了肉松海苔小贝、红豆蛋挞两个甜点 - 真滴很好吃，这也不算是掌握了烘焙这门技能，只是上手很容易，还是在小姨的耐心指导下完成的，学完就忘了一半，以后自己在外独立生活，这些烘焙技术得学会！除了烘焙技能，还有搭建博客，<del>这也不算是技能</del>，您现在所看到的博客网站是我按照教程一点点搭建出来的，DIY 了数月，算是掌握了吧，<del>大佬轻喷</del>，没有掌握的技能有建站和烹饪，在此说明下建站和搭建博客网站不太一样（博客框架是大佬开发的，我的工作只是使用此框架来上传博客和自定义美化它，相对于建站要简单很多）。2021 再接再厉，<del>大佬轻喷 Orz</del>。</p><h3 id="🎈-活动"><a href="#🎈-活动" class="headerlink" title="🎈 活动"></a>🎈 活动</h3><p>第三大板块<strong>活动</strong>，写这一板块的目的是希望能够拿更多的学分吧，谁还不是学分狗呢？<del>好像只有我</del>🙃。现在即将大三下了，一些扯淡的活动直接甩到九霄云外，不值得，不如多参加竞赛，提升自己学科能力。</p><h3 id="💴-收入"><a href="#💴-收入" class="headerlink" title="💴 收入"></a>💴 收入</h3><p>第四大板块<strong>收入</strong>，下半年拿了三等奖学金，说实话不得不感慨班上大佬太多了，本以为自己的综测分很高，结果发现还有更高的，还高的离谱，这还是人吗？当然了，还是得说一句，综测分不重要，学到真本事才是真。年初的时候，给熟人家孩子补过习，赚了一点 mula，emmm 海星，<del>大佬莫笑</del>。大学这个阶段本人认为，收入是次要的，以后出来混，<del>混出来了</del>，月薪可抵大学 4 年赚的，<del>传统功夫点到为止。</del></p><h3 id="💜-情感"><a href="#💜-情感" class="headerlink" title="💜 情感"></a>💜 情感</h3><p>第五大板块<strong>情感</strong>，小脸突然一红 😳，有点羞耻，世上哪有什么 Ms. Right，俺只配活在梦境里（苦笑.jpg）。一本正经地说，谈恋爱不应该成为目标，不能为了谈而谈，这个东西还得随缘，是对她未来的负责也是对自己未来的负责。To be honest，其实我已降低了无数门槛与标准，但难以找到自己十分钟意的，可能井底蛙本蛙得出去看看大世界了，当然，我自身肯定有一些不足之处，比如不主动，双商堪忧等等，有时候我又把不主动归结于自己没有十分的满意，其实，不断提高充实自己才能找到 better one，这点永不过时。<span class="hide-inline"><button type="button" class="hide-button" style="background-color: #1fc7b6;color: #fff">点击查看广告   </button><span class="hide-content">（关注我公众号可以通过聊天问出我相关问题的回答，能否触发我后台预设问题，看你自己怎么问哦hh，注意用第二人称）</span></span></p><h3 id="😀-外延与内涵"><a href="#😀-外延与内涵" class="headerlink" title="😀 外延与内涵"></a>😀 外延与内涵</h3><p>第六大板块<strong>外延与内涵</strong>，外延方面，希望能干干净净，彬彬有礼，不吐芬芳，<del>这是什么奇怪的人设</del>。其实在家时我比较邋遢和随意，在校时也没有以往那么爱“打扮”，可能是心累了，心思不在穿着打扮上，以前可能觉得整得摔摔七七的很有魅力，现在淡然了许多，我只不过是芸芸众生中普通的那一位，你最多只能当自己心目中的 Superstar。话说回来，这些自我要求还是得执行，让自己感到舒服快乐才是最好的。再来谈谈内涵方面，我心态一直以来比较积极向上阳光开朗，可能有时候容易被失败给绊倒然后质疑自己的能力，处于低迷状态，不过这种事情最后还是烟消云散。“求知若饥，虚心若愚”，这是 Steve·Jobs 的名言，在这一年中，我过于保持饥饿以至于东学西学，到了最后捡了芝麻丢了西瓜，成了个傻瓜，<del>skr</del>，计算机知识实在是太广了，所以得专攻一个自己喜欢的 part。</p><h3 id="📹-视频"><a href="#📹-视频" class="headerlink" title="📹 视频"></a>📹 视频</h3><p>第七大板块<strong>视频</strong>，原本是想继续学习拍摄剪辑技巧，但 2020 上半年由于疫情在家，学生会没有拍摄剪辑的任务，于是我这个部长就只当了半学期，所以这一整年除了纸婚祝福视频好像就没有其它剪辑项目，更别说上传 B 站了，现在想想还真得感谢那 76 个”粉丝“到现在还在关注我，真是泪目了 Orz。2021 年我也不太打算做视频，虽说 To Do List 写了一些视频计划，但我现阶段难以执行，看暑假有没有什么机会出去玩玩？这么一说好几年没有正儿八经的旅游了，说实话旅游 Vlog 也没啥人看，除非自己有人气，但当当自己生活的记录也挺好，万一哪天意外走红？<del>异想天开</del>，还是现在踏踏实实地做好一个普通而不平凡的人叭。</p><h3 id="🎵-音乐"><a href="#🎵-音乐" class="headerlink" title="🎵 音乐"></a>🎵 音乐</h3><p>第八大版块<strong>音乐</strong>，钢琴这一块现在也记不太清自己学了几首歌，其实学到的曲子数量并不重要，开心就好。<span class="hide-inline"><button type="button" class="hide-button" style="background-color: #1fc7b6;color: #fff">题外话   </button><span class="hide-content">（我的钢琴入门是我哥教的，在学校时我经常会看B站上的零基础视频，放假到家时会捣鼓捣鼓电子琴，说实话，没有专业要求的话钢琴入门真的super简单，只要会点和弦伴奏技巧和有~~亿~~一点点天赋，你能给市面上大多数流行音乐伴奏和演奏，其实不太需要看谱子，当然学习速度和效果还是因人而异吧，至于我，小时候就很喜欢音乐，对音乐各个层次领域的东西都有着持续关注和细微观察，以至于到了大学有充足时间后就疯了似的追求音乐方面的爱好，学琴的速度自然就快一些。好像通过我这一个行为，能悟出一个道理，要想在某一领域出类拔萃，你先得培养你的爱好，平时多思考，学前还得有相关知识的预习hh。像我正儿八经学习钢琴之前，就尝试过分析别人是怎么弹的，会考虑到一首歌的层次结构。其实我小的时候家里就买过电子琴，由于没有人教，就自己一根小指头点来点去，令我印象深刻的是，我当时一根手指弹了汶川大地震时经常放的歌《让世界充满爱》，这一切的一切使我在2年前那个夏天，SkyBro的指导下，半小时内学会了双手合奏《小星星》，我这学习速度令自己都震惊不已，~~低调低调~~，记得前几周我看了刘谦3周自学钢琴的B站视频（BV1Wt4y1r7km），评论区很多网友皆表示不可思议太厉害了，我心想真的没有你们想的那么难😂，可能外行人看门道内行人看笑话吧。其实我学琴前还一直不能理解，一个人的大脑是如何做到让两只手弹不同的音，But now，I've got it and made it!!! 如果有机会有心情，我可能会写我是如何快速上手钢琴的博客，没人看的话就当作自己的记录叭（这是在提前给自己挖坑？hh））</span></span>。然后，谈谈嘻哈这一块，我本人最喜欢的音乐风格是说唱，大概是从 17 年《有嘻哈》开始，在那之前有接触过嘻哈文化，当时只是觉得很酷但不知道那叫嘻哈（嘻哈四大板块：滑板、涂鸦、说唱、街舞），当然我这里只谈说唱，2020 年的计划是创作 2 首歌，但我只写了部分歌词（多个主题的），直到近几周我才考虑制作和发歌的问题，当然发歌只是为了好玩，愉悦自己，若能得到他人的赞美和共情也是我愿意看到的。制作方面的问题，目前也没有时间、金钱、经历和精力去学习正规流程的制作，我现在只能利用库乐队和 AU 来制作，其实库乐队和 AU 对于小白来说够了，库乐队甚至能使用 Auto-Tune 插件，记得当时买到插件的那一刻激动 s 我了，你能想象一个大男人对着 iPad 傻叫，然后监听自己加了 AT 效果的声音，最后边笑边听到自己实时电音效果的笑声后笑的愈演愈烈的场景吗？也许每个喜欢用 AT 的音乐人第一次使用它的场景跟我一样吧？可能只有我一个人私下的 reaction 太浮夸了。。最后，年初之时我还想着提高自己的 freestyle 的能力，可能有些人会问学这有啥用？你这是要参加《新说唱 x》《青你 x》《创 x》么？Nah！Not at all！只是为了愉悦自己，其实有时候在好友面前随便 free 几句还是蛮好玩，能活跃气氛。所以，为了提高 freestyle 能力，我有段时间专门看爆音（我称之为“中国即兴说唱之父”）直播的录播视频，深深佩服于他脑袋瓜的灵活、思维的转换能力、内容素材的丰富和押韵技巧的高超，总之学到了很多技巧和知识。<span class="hide-inline"><button type="button" class="hide-button" style="background-color: #1fc7b6;color: #fff">🎵 新歌预告   </button><span class="hide-content">（如果两大平台审核能通过并且不出什么意外的话，2.14号会发首R&B（节奏布鲁斯风格）情歌，寒假结束前会发首Melodic Trap（旋律陷阱音乐））</span></span></p><p>以上就是我对 2020 的总结。</p><h2 id="🐮-展望-2021"><a href="#🐮-展望-2021" class="headerlink" title="🐮 展望 2021"></a>🐮 展望 2021</h2><p>今年的计划与上一年有些许不同，简单说说大致不同和对自己的憧憬吧！</p><p><img src= "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/img/loading.gif" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hassan-assets/posts/Annual_Target/2021Target.png" alt="2021Target"></p><p>从板块上来说，<strong>健康</strong>板块增加了俯卧撑，虽然去年没有加，但实际上我有在执行这一项，请忽略我的完美主义（🦁 座还有这？）。<strong>学习</strong>板块，英语这里我计划是 2021 年和雅思菇凉分手，啊这，这不才谈了几天，就考虑分手的事情吗？对！I should find a new one! 然后词汇量破 10,000，这应该是雅思前任们的标配吧？maybe。然后计算机重点是学会建站，我可能和建站杠上了，因为两学期了，还是不会，之前老师教的时候，没怎么听，于是乎。。成绩方面稍微提高了目标分数，当然重点还是学习过程鸭，学到真本领才是真，鸭梨不要太大。自控方面添加了时间管理，<del>可能是受了亚洲舞王事件的影响</del>，但讲道理时间管理确实很重要，人的一生也就活个 30,000 天左右，没有多少时间给你去挥霍（wait! 我在写鸡汤吗？？）。再就是证书，增加了雅思、蓝桥杯和计算机四级。技能方面增加了绘画，毕竟去年氪金了 iPad Pro 2020 和 Apple Pencil Ⅱ，不整点活儿？当然有时间精力的话会学的，毕竟自己也有部分这方面的爱好，有时候爱好多了也不是件好事 🤔，所以时间管理很重要，适当分配时间陶怡情操。<strong>收入</strong>板块，尽量一等奖，赚钱也不强求，计算机学好了是不屑于学生时代赚的 mula。<strong>外延与内涵</strong>板块，增加了提高双商和干就完了别想太多两点，与其说是新年计划不如说是我对自己的要求，这应该是伴随自己一辈子的自我要求。<strong>视频</strong>板块删除很多地方，人的经历有限，只留下了拍照片、学习拍摄技巧和收藏剪辑素材这三大计划，至少 2021 年执行性很高。<strong>音乐</strong>板块，钢琴是还会继续学习的，嘻哈创作也会继续，<del>除非某一天江郎才尽</del>。</p><p>从思维导图整体上来说，一些图标、样式和英语表达有细微修改，布局有改变，取消了<strong>活动</strong>和<strong>情感</strong>两大板块，一是大三大四了，参与活动什么的不重要了，二是情感不能成为目标，要为自己未来人生深思熟虑，绝不能意气用事。</p><p>以上就是我对 2021 的展望，写了一下午的时间外加零碎时间的修改。Keep Moving!</p><blockquote><p><strong>结束语</strong>：</p><p>洋洋洒洒五千字，当做自己 2020~2021 人生轨迹的一个记录吧，期待一年后崭新的自己。<br>“苟日新，日日新，又日新”——《礼记·大学》</p></blockquote>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>不怕你词汇量低，就怕你学过最基础的单词都不知道如何使用，背那么多效果不明显（百词斩六七年用户的我路过），其实有好多常见单词咋们都没有掌握其<u>多种用法</u>，不如来了解了解，拓宽自己英语知识面。</p><p>遇到不会的我都会在此记录，望我们共同进步，干杯啦～</p></blockquote><h1 id="Nothing"><a href="#Nothing" class="headerlink" title="Nothing"></a>Nothing</h1><p>nothing 除了<u>什么都没有</u>这个意思，还有很多用法和含义，比如我一直以来都想知道易烊千玺的那首歌《Nothing to lose》的歌名翻译为啥是<u>义无反顾</u>。</p><h2 id="I-have-nothing-to-lose"><a href="#I-have-nothing-to-lose" class="headerlink" title="I have nothing to lose"></a>I have nothing to lose</h2><p>虽然 nothing to lose 的表面含义是没什么再可以失去了，你可以这么理解：既然什么都不会再失去了，那就勇敢尝试吧，反正不会有损失，毕竟结果不会比现在更糟糕。因此，nothing to lose 是积极向上的一句话，无消极之意。身边的亲人朋友遇到人生低谷时，不妨用 you have nothing to lose 鼓励他们奋发向上。</p><p>e.g. You have nothing to lose, why don&#39;t you give it a shot？</p><p>你都不会再失去什么了，为什么不放手一试呢？</p><h2 id="”一无所有”的英语表达"><a href="#”一无所有”的英语表达" class="headerlink" title="”一无所有”的英语表达"></a>”一无所有”的英语表达</h2><ol><li><p>have nothing at all</p><p>这是一无所有最简单的英文表达，at all 表示根本，可以加强语气。I have nothing at all 就是我根本什么都没有的意思。</p></li><li><p>be as bare as the palm of one’s hand</p><p>bare 是光秃秃的，palm 是手心，意思就是穷的就像是光秃秃的手掌心，表示一个人已经一无所有了。</p><p>e.g. In fact, I am as bare as the palm of my hand. Could you lend me some cash?（事实上，我现在一无所有了，你能借些现金给我吗？）</p></li><li><p>as poor as a church mouse 一文不名；一贫如洗。</p><p>教堂里的老鼠经常找不到食物，所以 as poor as a church mouse 就是说一个人一文不名。</p></li></ol><h2 id="be-nothing-to-someone"><a href="#be-nothing-to-someone" class="headerlink" title="be nothing to someone"></a>be nothing to someone</h2><p>对____来说是无所谓的</p><p>nothing 是无关紧要的</p><p>you are nothing to me 你对我而言根本就不重要</p><p>e.g. Mary is my first love, but she is nothing to me now.（玛丽是我的初恋，但现在她对我来说已经不重要了）</p><h2 id="have-nothing-on-someone"><a href="#have-nothing-on-someone" class="headerlink" title="have nothing on someone"></a>have nothing on someone</h2><p>A 远远比不上 B</p><p>nothing 是没有的意思，所以 you have nothing on me 表示和我比你什么都没有，言外之意就是你和我比差远了。</p><p>除此之外，have nothing on someone 也表示警察还没找到某人的犯罪证据。</p><p>e.g. I am good at cooking, but I have nothing on Jack.（我擅长烹饪，但是我和杰克比差远了）</p><h2 id="have-nothing-to-do-with-you"><a href="#have-nothing-to-do-with-you" class="headerlink" title="have nothing to do with you"></a>have nothing to do with you</h2><p>与你无关</p><p>have nothing to do with someone 与……毫不相干</p><p>表示处理时，do with 和 deal with 可以互换，但这里的 do with 的意思是有关系，所以 have nothing to do with someone 就是不关你的事。</p><p>这句话比较伤情面，大家说的时候语气最好和缓点。</p><p>e.g. It has nothing to do with you, so you&#39;d better not cut in.（这件事和你冇得啥子关系，所以你最好别插嘴）</p><blockquote><p>参考文章：<a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/137743904">老外说“I have nothing to lose”是什么意思？</a></p></blockquote><h1 id="Though-Tho"><a href="#Though-Tho" class="headerlink" title="Though | Tho"></a>Though | Tho</h1><p>though = tho，放在句末，是“然而 / 还是”的意思。</p><p>e.g. This keyboard is pretty good I guess, not amazing tho.（这键盘我觉得是蛮好的，但还/然而不是惊艳的）</p><p>e.g. It was a tough job, he accept it tho. （虽然这是份苦差事，但他还是接受了）</p><p>e.g. I like this, not the best tho.（我喜欢这个，尽管不是最好的）</p><blockquote><p>参考文章：<a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/62460502/answer/471515122">英语口语中的 tho 怎么用？</a></p></blockquote><h1 id="Over"><a href="#Over" class="headerlink" title="Over"></a>Over</h1><p>over + 时间段 = during</p><p>over + 名词 = on</p><p>over + 数字 = more than</p><h1 id="Most"><a href="#Most" class="headerlink" title="Most"></a>Most</h1><h2 id="Most-n-和-Most-of-n"><a href="#Most-n-和-Most-of-n" class="headerlink" title="Most + n. 和 Most of + n."></a>Most + n. 和 Most of + n.</h2><p>我经常听到 most people 和 most of the people 这样的表达，我经常会 get confused。</p><p>其实两者都是常用短语，意思也一样，唯一区别是 most people 更加 informal，而 most of the people 更加 formal。</p><div style="text-align:center;background:var(--harris-card-bg);border-radius:12px"><p style="color:#ce6a28;font-size:24px;display:inline-block;margin:6px 0">☕欲知后事如何，</p><p style="color:#a8c212;font-size:24px;display:inline-block;margin:6px 0">且听下回分解🍵</p></div>]]></content>
